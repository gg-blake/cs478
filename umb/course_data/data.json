Over the course of two-week modules, we will delve into comprehending a new function of business and discover how these principles apply and become relevant in real-world business environments through an integrated course project to which each student contributes:  a social impact business plan. The social impact business plan is a strategic document that outlines how a business intends to address a social or environmental challenge, while maintaining financial viability. We add to these practical areas an understanding of the contexts in which business operates - law, government, society, rapidly changing technology, new risks, the changing nature of careers, increasingly diverse workforces, and the broad global reach of business.

The dance form involves ''a complex array of interlocking rhythms, percussive accents of isolated body parts popping out in unexpected phrasing,'' (Andre Lepecki, ed., Of the Presence of the Body, 2004). Key figures in its early development in the 1970's are Afrika Baambata, a rapper who is credited with forming the first group of hip hop dancers, and DJ Kool Herc of Jamaican origin who brought his two turntables to the block parties in the South Bronx. Its influences range from African dance and Brazilian Capoeira to James Brown, Michael Jackson and, more recently, music videos. This course covers the variety of components that make up Hip Hop Dance: poppin', lockin', wavin', steppin', top rockin', and downrockin' and basic breakin'. The course material will help students develop strength, coordination and a strong mental focus while they thoroughly enjoy moving themselves to the lively rhythms of hip hop music. This is a practical course in which the great majority of time will be spent practicing dance technique and choreography. While we may occasionally view a video, most of our time will be spent actually dancing. We will become familiar with basic Hip Hop moves and practice putting these moves into combination in challenging ways. We will further enhance our knowledge of Hip Hop through the writing of two papers.

''They must be trying to get my new invention,'' you think. You suspected that once word got out, villains would want to get their hands on this powerful new tool, you just didn't think it would happen this quickly. You know you must prevent them at all costs. After all, whoever controls this new technological invention can rule the world. Your mission is to save the world, that is in the context of the game story in this class. To do so, you are not expected to begin with any coding skills but must learn basic coding concepts such as debugging, looping, and Boolean logic to solve a series of problems embedded within this game story in order to advance the storyline. Designed like a video game, it is an asynchronous online course that can be completed at your own pace. By the end of the class, you will code your own interactive game using a block-based programming language.

While students in Composition I focus primarily on writing to make meaning, students in Composition II learn how writing produces knowledge. Students come to understand writing as a knowledge-producing activity through carefully sequenced and scaffolded assignments that encourage them to develop, sustain, and reflect on their own academic inquiry and research processes. Assignments ask students to develop original research questions, locate and evaluate primary and secondary sources, select evidence from multiple complex texts, synthesize evidence-based arguments that use sources to address their inquiry, and reflect on their own learning and development. In conjunction with Composition I, students in Composition II continue to develop the ability to generate and articulate their own claims in dialogue with texts and to develop rhetorical awareness and knowledge of academic discourse conventions. The flexible, adaptable writing knowledge and practices developed across Composition I and Composition II are designed to facilitate students' ability to write self-reflectively in other contexts, which includes intermediate seminars, upperlevel courses, and the Writing Proficiency Requirement.", "Pre Requisites": "  Pre-req = ENGL 101;

Attention will also be paid to other important female writers of her time in the attempt to understand Austen's posthumous elevation to literary stardom.", "Pre Requisites": "  Pre-requisite:  ENGL 200 or 201 or 202"}, "sessions": [{"Section": "01", "Class Number": "10408", "Schedule/Time": "TuTh9:30 - 10:45 am", "Instructor": "Fay,Elizabeth A", "Location": "McCormack M01-0616", "More Info": "", "Session: ": "Regular", "Class Dates: ": "01/27/2025 - 05/14/2025", "Capacity: ": "24", "Enrolled: ": "0", "Status: ": "Open", "Credits: ": "3/3", "Class Notes: ": "", "Pre Requisites: ": "  Pre-requisite:  ENGL 200 or 201 or 202", "Course Attributes: ": "Humanities"}]}, "ENGL401": {"id": "ENGL401", "title": "The Medieval Period", "course_descriptors": {"Description": "Lyrics, romances, mystery plays, allegories of English literature in the period before the sixteenth century.

Drawing on a wide range of texts, we will pursue the following avenues of inquiry: What do we mean by the term ''Empire''? How has the reach of Empire been historically constructed, critiqued in fiction, and/or sustained through narrative: What forms of identity are available to individuals who have been displaced, either through personal choice or random (and often tragic) circumstance? And, finally, how ''post'' is postcolonialism? To answer these and related questions, this course will further explore the different experiences of colonization, decolonization, and postcolonial culture and politics during the twentieth century in South Africa, Nigeria, Jamaica, India, Australia, and Northern Ireland. Taking a transdisciplinary approach, we will conduct inquiries into the nature of sociopolitical and cultural conditions that characterize current or former colonies, the diverse registers in which these conditions are discursively articulated, and the modes, spaces, and politics of their (re)production, circulation, and consumption. Some themes this course will address include the psychology of colonization and settlement; violence and decolonization; constructions of the ''Other'' by imperial center; hybrid cultural formations wrought by the impacts between colonizer and colonized. Taking the above statement by Ghosh as instructive, this course will also seek to interrogate the idea that culture is a coherent or self-contained whole; thus, the final portion of this class will address themes of travel, immigration, and concepts of the diaspora, homeland, and exile by attending to the ''new'' cosmopolitanism.", "Pre Requisites": "  Pre-requisite:  ENGL 200 or 201 or 202"}, "sessions": [{"Section": "01", "Class Number": "10409", "Schedule/Time": "TuTh11:00 - 12:15 pm", "Instructor": "Brown,Matthew S", "Location": "Wheatley W01-0062", "More Info": "", "Session: ": "Regular", "Class Dates: ": "01/27/2025 - 05/14/2025", "Capacity: ": "23", "Enrolled: ": "0", "Status: ": "Open", "Credits: ": "3/3", "Class Notes: ": "", "Pre Requisites: ": "  Pre-requisite:  ENGL 200 or 201 or 202", "Course Attributes: ": "International, World Cultures"}]}, "ENGL448": {"id": "ENGL448", "title": "Perspectives on Literacy", "course_descriptors": {"Description": "A study of the theories of literacy, in its relation to human thinking and to social uses and contexts; and of the practice of literacy, in the teaching, learning, and use of literate behaviors in contemporary American society.

Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing segment of the food industry, with more then half of what we eat from the ocean coming from aquaculture. This is an increasingly competitive space that suffers from a tradition of malpractice and misunderstanding as well as a regulatory culture that lags far behind an innovative rate. Site selection, gear, seed and feed procurement, marketing, and supply chain dynamics are all important elements of a successful aquaculture operation that demand an understanding of regulatory, financial, and marketing and entrepreneurial principles. This course is designed to introduce students to these challenges and equip them with the tools needed to engage within the industry on a sophisticated, successful level. Students will gain a foundational understanding of how to move from ''I would like to operate an aquaculture business'' to ''I am operating an aquaculture business''. Building on this understanding, students will prepare their own business plans to demonstrate mastery of key aspects of operational efficiency necessary support the vital financial structure of any business. Lastly, through the concepts of entrepreneurship, students will learn how to integrate business concepts to be able to develop and sustain a successful aquaculture business. This course will be organized into three parts: Essentials for a business in aquaculture, operating a business in aquaculture, and moving from concept to execution. This course alludes to but does not deeply discuss the complex and ever changing regulatory, policy, and legal systems that govern operations in this sector."}, "sessions": [{"Section": "01", "Class Number": "9126", "Schedule/Time": " - ", "Instructor": "Bender,Jennifer Ellen|Garfield,Seth", "Location": "On-line course", "More Info": "", "Session: ": "Regular", "Class Dates: ": "01/27/2025 - 05/14/2025", "Capacity: ": "40", "Enrolled: ": "0", "Status: ": "Open", "Credits: ": "3/3", "Class Notes: ": "", "Pre Requisites: ": "", "Course Attributes: ": " "}]}, "ENVSCI150L": {"id": "ENVSCI150L", "title": "Introduction to Climate Change", "course_descriptors": {"Description": "Introduction to Climate Change covers the processes involved in Earth's climate and the history of climate up to the present day, with a key goal of gaining insight into ongoing climate change and the future.

The impacts of anthropogenic development and climate change extend from the bustling city of Boston to the outer reaches of Boston Harbor Islands and the consequences of these impacts are shared across UMass-Boston's neighboring communities (e.g. Quincy, Dorchester, and East Boston) and abiotic and biotic communities. Thus, this course will investigate the evolving relationships between people, plants, and animals across this aquatic landscape from a transdisciplinary basis, the integration of knowledge systems to move beyond discipline specific problem-solving approaches. Students will learn how to conduct archival research and scientific experiments, participate in service-learning opportunities, and engage in roundtable discussions with local indigenous communities, environmental organizations, and researchers. The culmination of these activities will introduce students to methods they can employ for their final project: a proposal on a research topic they would like to lead at the Living Laboratory on Rainsford Island, Boston Harbor Islands.

We will consider society and history through literature, so texts like sonnets, love letters, and excerpts from novels will make up the bulk of our reading.

In this course we will engage with the neighborhoods, culture, and people of the Boston area through primary data collection such as conducting interviews or participant observation. Using our sociological imaginations, we will draw on sociological theories and concepts to analyze data we have gathered and locate our data in the larger context of local, national, and global social structures. We will learn to use the library to locate scholarly resources as well as participate in activities that seek to improve writing skills in order to successfully complete the written portion of our research projects. These writing activities will include developing a research question or puzzle, constructing a thesis statement or argument, using scholarly research to support your arguments, explaining your methods for data collection, and effectively deploying theory or concepts to answer 'why' questions about your data. Through this engagement with the Boston area, we explore the careers students may pursue with a BA or higher degree in sociology. To this end, we will learn effective paths for completing a BA in sociology and learn about research that sociologists at UMass Boston are currently engaged in. Therefore, this course is designed for and open to declared sociology majors. Non sociology majors must receive instructor approval to join this course.

The course also provides the opportunity to explore these research methods: critical-ethnographic case studies, oral history, classroom ethnography, interviews, narrative, and critical document analysis."}, "sessions": [{"Section": "01", "Class Number": "10537", "Schedule/Time": "Th4:00 - 6:45 pm", "Instructor": "Carhill Poza,Avary Jeanne", "Location": "University Hall Y02-2100", "More Info": "", "Session: ": "Regular", "Class Dates: ": "01/27/2025 - 05/14/2025", "Capacity: ": "8", "Enrolled: ": "0", "Status: ": "Open", "Credits: ": "3/3", "Class Notes: ": "", "Pre Requisites: ": "", "Course Attributes: ": "Non-degree exclude from list"}]}, "APLING890": {"id": "APLING890", "title": "Graduate Colloquium in Applied Linguistics", "course_descriptors": {"Description": "APLING 890 is a 1-credit course designed to engage participants in critical reading, analysis, and discussion of topics related to the theory, research and practice in Applied Linguistics.

They represent a form a structural power; some groups systematically benefit relative to others as a result of how organizations operate. Organizations are frequently the target of public policy, as they are sites of both societal aspirations (productivity, innovation, opportunities for advancement) and societal challenges (inequality, discrimination, pollution, deception). Organizations can also be arenas of resistance and change, advancing new ideas and addressing old problems. An understanding of organizations - their sources of power, their role in governance, and their structures and processes - is therefore highly relevant for future researchers who wish to conduct studies of use for policy analysts, activists, and managers in the private, public, and non-profit sectors."}, "sessions": [{"Section": "01", "Class Number": "9715", "Schedule/Time": "W4:00 - 6:45 pm", "Instructor": "Dorado-Banacloche,Silvia", "Location": "University Hall Y02-2320", "More Info": "", "Session: ": "Regular", "Class Dates: ": "01/27/2025 - 05/14/2025", "Capacity: ": "12", "Enrolled: ": "0", "Status: ": "Open", "Credits: ": "3/3", "Class Notes: ": "", "Pre Requisites: ": "", "Course Attributes: ": " "}]}, "BUSADM771": {"id": "BUSADM771", "title": "Contemporary Research Practice on Management, Organizations, and Social Change", "course_descriptors": {"Description": "This course is required for all doctoral students in the Ph.D. in Business Administration, Organizations and Social Change (OSC) track.

The course will focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. We shall be especially attentive to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge and in their connections to methodologies and research methods. Further, we shall explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and / or problematic for feminist inquiry."}, "sessions": [{"Section": "01", "Class Number": "14058", "Schedule/Time": "Tu4:00 - 6:45 pm", "Instructor": "Barcelos,Chris", "Location": "Wheatley W01-0062", "More Info": "", "Session: ": "Regular", "Class Dates: ": "01/27/2025 - 05/14/2025", "Capacity: ": "15", "Enrolled: ": "0", "Status: ": "Open", "Credits: ": "3/3", "Class Notes: ": "", "Pre Requisites: ": "", "Course Attributes: ": " "}]}}
