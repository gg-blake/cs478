The Psychology major is a 12 course major. The requirements of these 12 courses provide students with a foundation in each of five core areas of the discipline of psychology, upper level coursework in one or more areas and basic information about the research practices used in the field. The basic structure of the major is represented by four parts. The phrase “major requirements” refers to the minimum number and distribution of psychology courses a student must complete successfully in order to graduate as a psychology major. We encourage students to take more than the minimum number of courses in psychology and allied disciplines. Only one of the 12 required classes may be taken pass/fail; the other 11 classes must be taken for a grade.  Eight of the 12 courses for the major must be taken in residence at UMass Boston.
