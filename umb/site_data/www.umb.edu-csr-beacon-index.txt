BEACON allowed Boston area residents to voice their perspectives, needs, and thoughts on recurrent concerns and new developments. The study identified policy issues and program needs to empower, support, and inform researchers, policymakers, cultural leaders, practitioners, and community organizations throughout the region. With its panel approach, BEACON monitored trends over time on important topics such as economic mobility, resident safety, and participation in civic culture. The BEACON gave Boston residents' voices a chance to be heard on issues like taxes, the way the city is run, and the services the city provides.
