Additional Information Dr. Hayes-Skelton’s current research focuses on psychotherapy for anxiety disorders.  Her work examines cognitive-behavioral and acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches to behavior change in both clinical and analogue settings. She is particularly committed to enhancing the cultural-sensitivity of these treatments. Her research focuses on the processes and mechanisms responsible for therapeutic change.   In other words, how and why therapy works.  Her recent research has examined the role of decentering and emotional processing in therapeutic change.
