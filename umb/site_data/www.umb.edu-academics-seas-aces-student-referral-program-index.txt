Referrals may be made at any point in the semester, though the sooner the student can meet with us, the better the chance for a positive outcome. Make a Student Referral Here Who should be referred? Any UMass Boston undergraduate student can be referred. If a faculty member has been unsuccessful in resolving an issue, they may refer students for one or more of the reasons listed below: Personal issues affecting academics Unresponsiveness to faculty email outreach Study skills, writing skills, and organizational challenges Low quiz / test grades Frequent absences ESL challenges Is a student at risk of harming him/herself or others? If the situation is urgent and life threatening, call the police: If you are off campus, call 911 If you are on campus using a landline, call 911 If you are on campus using a cell phone, call 617.287.1212 If the situation is urgent but not life threatening, please follow the Distressed and Distressing student protocol. Contact the Dean of Students Office at 617.287.5899 or at dean.students@umb.edu . What do we do? A staff member from the Center for Academic Excellence will meet with students, assess their needs, and develop a plan to enable them to succeed in the class at hand as well as to move on academically with the goal of successfully completing their degree at UMass Boston. We collaborate closely with faculty and often refer students to other resources on campus such as the Counseling Center. Have you been referred? If you are a student who has been referred, you will receive an email and a phone call to get you connected with the right advisor or coach. There are many resources that you may find helpful, such as: UMB-UR-Best Academic Support Programs Counseling Center U-Access (for a benefits/financial screening and food pantry services) Distressed and Distressing (others) Student Protocol Read More Dean of Student Referrals For students who have non-academic related concerns Read More Make a Student Referral For students who have academic related concerns Read More UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright Â© University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
