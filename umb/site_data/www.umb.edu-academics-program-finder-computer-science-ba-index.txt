Develop an understanding of the theory and practice of computer science. Our BA program provides an education in the theory and practice of Computer Science with an emphasis on outside humanities. This degree can be used as a basis for many jobs in industry or for graduate work in Computer Science and other fields. We have an Honors Program for students who complete an Honors Thesis. Degree-seeking students must also satisfy the other requirements of the college such as the University Residency Requirement, Writing Proficiency requirement, Quantitative reasoning requirements, General Distribution requirement, Diversity requirement, Verbal Reasoning and Expression requirement, and the First-Year and Intermediate Seminars requirement. These are not listed here. Some students may find that their scores on the department's placement test indicate that they are not yet qualified to take CS110 or Math140. Such students will begin their coursework with Math130 (Pre-calculus) or possibly Math115 (College Algebra). Credits earned in those courses count toward the degree, but not toward the major.
