A new paid summer internship program will train you to work as a care manager at a Boston-area nonprofit serving older adults. The Department of Gerontology at UMass Boston has created the Pathways to Building an Aging Services Workforce program to introduce undergraduate students to the aging services field. Twelve students will be selected during winter break to start their internships Jan 22, 2024. They will gain training and work experience that will qualify them, upon graduation, for jobs as care managers. Currently, some 600 care management positions are available across Massachusetts for qualified applicants. Care managers talk with people who are seeking assistance, arrange with contracted providers who offer care, then monitor and assess how the care is going. Pathways interns will complete online course work along with 360 hours of work over two semesters, (roughly 12 hours/week at a rate of $15.25/hour) with one of four agencies: Mystic Valley Elder Services Boston Senior Home Care Ethos Central Boston Elder Services.
