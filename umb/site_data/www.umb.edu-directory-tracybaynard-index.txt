My overall research program is aimed at understanding how exercise can be utilized to maximize health among populations with chronic conditions. As such, my work has developed to examine the interactions between exercise and cardiovascular function in these special populations. Individuals with chronic disease often have extreme exercise intolerance, which is not well understood to date. Furthermore, those with chronic conditions also tend to have a lower ability to increase physical fitness, compared to the general population engaged in a traditional exercise training program.  Understanding why this is and developing interventions around these findings is also an important interest area for our laboratory.
