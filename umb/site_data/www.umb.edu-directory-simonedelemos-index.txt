She approaches language-learning as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary effort in which language acquisition, linguistics, cognitive science, and cultural studies co-exist and inform one another. Simone sees the language-learning classroom as an opportunity for students to use the target languages to learn and reflect about the universe that surrounds us and the questions and issues we face in the 21st century from the perpectives of the Spanish-speaking and the Portuguese-speaking peoples.
