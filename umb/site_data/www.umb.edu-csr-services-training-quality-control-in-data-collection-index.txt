All interviewers (field and telephone interviewers) receive general initial training plus study-specific training at the initiation of each study. As part of training, interviewers have to pass written tests and perform practice interviews. Interviewing at CSR involves continuous evaluation and learning. New interviewers’ work is heavily monitored by supervisors in the first weeks, and samples of all interviewers' work are systematically monitored throughout each study.  Interviewers' work is also routinely checked by supervisors by calls or visits to a sub-sample of each interviewer's cases. In addition to ensuring quality control during interviewing, CSR also double enters and verifies all completed self-administered mail surveys.
