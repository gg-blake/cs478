Get specialized training to serve English learners in Massachusetts schools. UMass Boston’s English Language Development (ELD) Certificate is a stand-alone graduate certificate in Applied Linguistics for teachers who are either licensed in another area of study or are seeking a pathway to an ESL Initial Licensure in Massachusetts. Students take five courses that delve deeply into the theory and practice of English learning instruction. The 15–credit certificate is perfect for in-service teachers who want to add an initial license in ESL, in-service teachers who already hold an initial license in ESL and are planning to apply for professional licensure in ESL, and all teachers who work with English learners and want to gain ESL knowledge, theory, and practice. The ELD Certificate was developed as part of the Centering Relationships, Equity, and Access for Teachers of English Learners (CREATE) Project at UMass Boston. CREATE was designed to increase individual, educator, and district capacity to serve English learners in eight high-needs urban school districts in Greater Boston. Part of the philosophy of this project is the belief in the importance of diversity and bilingualism, and these values are ever-present in this program—not only are they reflected in the certificate’s coursework, but in the entire program, from mentoring opportunities to making the certificate as accessible as possible to teachers of all different races, ethnicities, and language abilities. Since this certificate is offered through the Applied Linguistics program, it is grounded in faculty research and theoretical and pedagogical advances in the linguistics field. The program is open to all pre-service and in-service teachers, including current Applied Linguistics and UMass Boston master's students. Educators from across Greater Boston are strongly encouraged to apply. Should an ELD Certificate student decide to apply to UMass Boston’s MA program in Applied Linguistics, the five courses taken as part of this certificate may be transferred to that degree.
