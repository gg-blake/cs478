    UMass Boston News This is the first of a series of Beacon Profiles spotlighting our outstanding faculty and leadership at the university. Each spotlight offers a look at the unique expertise, innovative teaching, and inspiring stories that shape the UMass Boston community. Watch video Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Karen Ferrer-Muñiz has dedicated the past 25 years of her career to student life and development. Since arriving at UMass Boston two years ago, she says she deeply values the campus's diversity, which fosters a sense of belonging—a feeling she hopes all students experience. “Continuing student success at UMass Boston is really tied to some of the specific programs that we have that give some students a sense of security outside of the classroom … focusing on student needs when it comes to finances, when it comes to housing, food, and their wellness on campus,” Ferrer-Muñiz said. She highlights initiatives like the U-ACCESS program for food insecurity, the introduction of a support dog to promote wellness, and expanded services at the Counseling Center, all aimed at ensuring students feel secure and supported on campus.
