Additional Information Sun-Young Park (PhD, University of Florida) is an associate professor of communication at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Her scholarly interests involve strategic communication campaigns which help promote healthy and pro-social behaviors. Specifically, based on consumer/social psychology theories and experimental research methods, she is interested in examining the effects of advertising campaigns in promoting healthy behaviors (e.g., anti-binge drinking, HPV vaccination) and pro-social behaviors (e.g., recycling). Her research also measures the effectiveness of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities (e.g., supporting responsible drinking, fair labor practices, and sustainability development communication) and celebrity endorsement for both nonprofit and for-profit sectors. Recently, she conducts collaborative research exploring data-driven and social psychology models that advance our fundamental understanding of how early stage high-tech startups form and evolve via social media. She won the 2012 American Academy of Advertising (AAA) Doctoral Dissertation Award, and has presented numerous peer-reviewed papers at national and international conferences. She has taught various courses in the field of advertising and public relations, including principles, research and strategy, and campaigns, and integrated marketing communications, and served as a faculty advisor for American Advertising Federation (AAF) National Student Advertising Competition (NSAC). Before joining academia, she worked as an account executive at Innocean Worldwide, an in-house advertising agency of Hyundai Kia Automotive Group.
