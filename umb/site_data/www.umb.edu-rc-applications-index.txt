They are located within the shared software directory.  This directory is /share/apps.  On gibbs, software applications can be found in /shared/software.  Some packages may also be under /opt or /usr/local. Software can also be installed local to a user account.  This may be the best option if you are the sole user of the application, or if it is regularly being modified and recompiled. In general, using the system software or software via the module command is preferred (options 1 and 2, above).  Depending on your specific needs, it may be more appropriate to set the appropriate environment variables directly in your scripts or makefiles (i.e. option 3).
