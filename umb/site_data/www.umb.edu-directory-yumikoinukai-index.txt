Hume), William James, nature and phenomenology of the self Degrees PhD, University of Pennsylvania, 2005 Professional Publications & Contributions "Perceptions and Objects: Hume's Radical Empiricism," Hume Studies, 37 (2), 2013 "Honen and James on Religious Transformation: Psychological Conditions of Conversion and the Nembutsu," Philosophy East and West, 62 (4), October 2012 "James’ Answer to Hume: the Empirical Basis of the Unified Self," British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 20 (2), April 2012 "Hume on Relations: Are They Real?" Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 40 (2), June 2010 “Hume’s Labyrinth: The Bundling Problem,” History of Philosophy Quarterly, 24 (3), July 2007 Additional Information My research has been focused on David Hume, in particular, his theory of mind and his account of the self. I have been working on questions about the nature and phenomenology of the self, exploring the empiricist accounts found in Hume and James as well as contemporary debates over the self and self-consciousness. I am also interested in a comparative study between “western” and “non-western” philosophical traditions, in which I particularly investigate the Buddhist conception and phenomenology of the self and their relation to two most practiced methods in Buddhism, the recitation of “Nembutsu” and sitting meditation.
