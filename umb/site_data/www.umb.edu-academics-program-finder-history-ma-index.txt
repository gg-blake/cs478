Acquire the analytical tools, research skills, and critical thinking abilities you need to succeed in the historical fields. UMass Boston's Master of Arts Program in History offers you a rigorous yet flexible program of study in the field of history. Rather than being merely a collection of courses, the History MA program requires intense commitment to historical scholarship and practice. The MA serves as a terminal degree for you to seek exposure to historical study before entering a variety of careers, or a PhD program at another institution. The History MA program is designed to enhance your research, writing, and analytical skills, as well as provide a broad and advanced background in history content. Our location in Boston offers you access to a variety of archives, libraries, museums, and historical sites. Plus, the University is located next to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, the Massachusetts State Archives, and the Commonwealth Museum. Courses are taught by full-time History faculty, and are generally in the late afternoon and early evening to accommodate working students and those with other obligations. Classes are taught as small seminars with no more than 15 students per class. Courses cover U.S., European, and non-Western topics, allowing you to sample a range of historical topics. Students earning a Master of Arts in History have the option of choosing from two tracks: History (Online or In-Person) or Public History (In-Person) .

For more detailed information on costs, visit the Bursar's website for more information. Assistantships: Each year, the History Department offers a limited number of Graduate Assistantships to newly admitted graduate students. Assistantships are “half-time”, which means students are expected to work 9 hours per week for the academic year. As compensation, graduate assistants receive a bi-weekly stipend. Graduate Assistants also receive a 100 percent tuition remission for the contract period and a 50 percent waiver of their Educational Operations Fee. There are some remaining student fees that Assistants have to pay. If Assistants get their health insurance through the university, they will also receive a discount on their Health Insurance Premium. Assistants work as teaching assistants or research assistants. Teaching assistants are assigned to professors who teach large lecture sections. These assistants will assist with grading and general operation of the class. They may be asked to do research work for their professor. Research assistants are usually assigned to faculty members to assist them with their research projects. Other assistants may be assigned to the Graduate Program Director, the Undergraduate Program Director, the Public History Director, and the University Archives. Each year, one Graduate Assistant is assigned to assist the editors of the New England Quarterly, which is housed at UMass Boston. Online MA students are not eligible for Graduate Assistantships. You do not need to specify your interest in an Assistantship. All admitted students will be considered for an assistantship. Admitted students will receive notification of an assistantship award after they are formally accepted into the program. History Track (In-Person or Online) UMass Boston's Master of Arts in History offers a rigorous set of individually selected courses and supervised research and writing. Both demanding and flexible, the history track is designed for students who intend to pursue a PhD, secondary school teachers who wish to improve their knowledge of the field, and students who seek to test their capacity for graduate work. Knowledge of a foreign language is not required for the Master of Arts in History. Thesis advisors may require a foreign language if they determine that competence in a particular language is necessary for students to conduct research on the topic on which a student will write his or her thesis. In that case, students must demonstrate competence in the foreign language to the satisfaction of their advisors. The History MA program offers an online MA. Online courses are available to students enrolled in the traditional History MA program. View the History MA curriculum The History Department also offers Certificate in Public History and a Certificate in History . A Certificate is not an MA degree, but it can be earned while also earning a History MA. Public History Track (In-Person) Public historians study the way we remember and interpret the past. They use historical methodologies to preserve, collect, present, and interpret history with and for public audiences. Public historians work with historic landscapes, sites, parks and monuments; in museums and historic buildings; on film and the internet; and with community groups and organizations, families, and institutions. They study public awareness and consciousness of the past and how various actors, including public intellectuals and public interest groups, seek to “raise” historical consciousness and nurture historical thinking. Training in historical methodology is a crucial foundation for practicing public historians. That is reflected in the structure of this program—public history students earn an MA in History rather than a specialized MA in Public History. Public History students need to gain strong subject-area knowledge and research skills, as well as an introduction to the theory and methods of public history. This model provides a cross-disciplinary approach that benefits professional training for public history students.

Curriculum - History Track History Track: UMass Boston's Master of Arts in History offers a rigorous set of individually selected courses and supervised research and writing. Both demanding and flexible, the history track is designed for students who intend to pursue a PhD, secondary school teachers who wish to improve their knowledge of the field, and students who seek to test their capacity for graduate work. The program is designed to accommodate teachers with a demanding schedule but who wish to pursue their MA part time. Those who desire to pursue advanced study for their own intellectual enjoyment and development can also benefit from the program’s design, and the department welcomes prospective students who have been out of school for a long time or who have majored in other areas of study and now wish to pursue the study of history. All graduate courses consist of small seminars of no more than fifteen students, which affords all students close faculty attention and support. Not all students enter the graduate programs in history directly from college: the student body includes individuals who beginning graduate work after long absences from school. Applicants do not need to have majored in history as undergraduates, but they may be asked to pursue a program of coursework designed to remedy deficiencies in their preparation for graduate study. Knowledge of a foreign language is not required for the Master of Arts in History. Thesis advisors may require a foreign language if they determine that competence in a particular language is necessary for students to conduct research on the topic on which a student will write his or her thesis. In that case, students must demonstrate competence in the foreign language to the satisfaction of their advisors. For those writing a Thesis: HIST 600: Research and Methods HIST 605: Introduction to Historiography HIST 690: Final Project Prep (Students should have at least 18 credits before taking FPP) HIST 699: Thesis Five electives, two of which can be upper-level undergraduate courses (300 level or higher) For those writing a History Review Essay: HIST 600: Research and Methods HIST 605: Introduction to Historiography HIST 690: Final Project Prep (Students should have at least 18 credits before taking FPP) HIST 693: History Review Essay Six electives, two of which can be upper-level undergraduate courses (300 level or higher) Thesis The thesis stands as the traditional culmination of a student’s graduate work, and students who wish to pursue a PhD should plan to write a thesis. The thesis should be approximately 50-70 pages long and based on original research. It should be the equivalent to an article in a scholarly journal. Theses are written under the guidance of an individual faculty advisor and defended before a committee of three faculty members, one of whom may be from outside the department. For more information on thesis requirements, see the Graduate Program Handbook. History Review Essay The History Review Essay is an alternative to the thesis. This option is only for students in the History Track. These essays are 25-30 page reviews of existing literature that demonstrate wide, deep reading in and extensive knowledge of the student’s chosen field. They are equivalent to the “state of the field” essays that appear regularly in scholarly journals. Essays showcase the student’s ability to synthesize, analyze, and evaluate secondary texts by asking critical questions about historiography, research methods, sources, and theory. History Review Essays are as challenging as theses, but highlight different skills. They are especially appropriate for those who do not plan future academic publications, for teachers looking to synthesize a broad range of scholarship, and for those who do not have ready access to primary source repositories.
