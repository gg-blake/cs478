In Roubelakis-Angelakis KA, Ed., Plant Morphogenesis: Molecular Approaches, Plenum Press, NY Additional Information Research Interests Adán Colón-Carmona’s research examines the contribution of cell division to the regulation of organ growth during plant development. Specifically, his lab studies how cell cycle checkpoints are influenced by both internal and external cues, including hormones and stress signals. The role of the motor proteins kinesins in regulating mitotic checkpoint is of specific interest. The Colón-Carmona Lab also studies how development in plants is altered in response to exposure to environmental pollutants such as the petroleum-based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Using molecular genetic approaches, including bioinformatics and systems biology, the lab hopes to identify genes that could potentially be used to bioengineer plants to biodegrade and biodetect PAHs. This technology will be used in collaboration with a third project on root development and how the root microbiome is established both in normal and stressful growth conditions. Finally, he investigates how students learn and succeed in STEM fields, particularly those traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.
