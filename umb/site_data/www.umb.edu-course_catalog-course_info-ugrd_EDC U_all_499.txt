Students demonstrate their teaching skills in a school, with supervision by both a certified cooperating teacher and a member of the University faculty. They also attend a seminar led by the latter. The seminar provides an opportunity for student teachers to share their practicum experiences, to try out and critique plans and ideas, to air and solve problems, and to reflect on the process by which they are becoming education professionals. Notes: A formal application to do a practicum must be filed with the Advising Office by October 1 for a spring practicum or by March 1 for a fall practicum.
