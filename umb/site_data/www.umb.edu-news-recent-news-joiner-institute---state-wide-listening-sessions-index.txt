    Office of Communications Will Host Virtual Listening Session July 18 UMass Boston’s William Joiner Institute for the Study of War and Social Consequences recently joined in a memorandum of understanding with the Massachusetts Executive Office of Veteran Services (EOVS) to provide Listening Session support and documentation in order to synthesize and assess data, interpret results as they relate to other relevant studies, and provide input to help shape the ultimate recommendations of the Women Veteran Advisory Committee (WVAC) to Governor Healey. Governor Healey’s WVAC is holding listening sessions throughout the Commonwealth through the end of July 2024 to gather information around concerns, challenges, needs, and best practices as it relates to female veteran supports, benefits, services and opportunities. The information being collected will be used to help guide and advise the WVAC in putting forward recommendations to enhance the women veteran experience in Massachusetts. “We are very pleased to have enlisted the support of UMass Boston’s William Joiner Institute for the Study of War and Social Consequences to help facilitate this important initiative to hear from our female veteran population,” said Dr. Andrea Gayle-Bennett, Deputy Secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Veteran Services. “Partnering with the Wiliam Joiner Institute team has added some much-needed support and research expertise that will be critical in evaluating the data and input received so we can identify actionable recommendations that will make a positive difference for our women Veterans across the state.” “Joining with the Executive Office of Veteran Services to support the efforts of the Governor’s WVAC is a great opportunity for the Joiner Institute to hear first-hand what issues our female veterans are facing here in the Commonwealth,” said Brendan O’Connor, Director of the William Joiner Institute. “This initiative is fully aligned with our mission to inform, develop, and implement equitable policies, programs, and pathways to help ensure the health, safety, well-being, and success of our veterans, their families, and others impacted by war or military service.” The William Joiner Institute will be hosting a virtual listening session on July 18, from noon to 1 p.m. Attendees will include members of the WVAC and Deputy Secretary Gayle-Bennett.  To register, visit Virtual Listening Session .
