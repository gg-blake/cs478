Application Deadlines for Fall 2024: July 5th for new international students August 23rd for resident and transfer students The Intensive English Language & University Preparation Program Pathway Program is designed for students who wish to learn English for academic, professional, or personal reasons. This program is recommended for all students (residents and international students) seeking full-time admission into our undergraduate programs at UMass Boston. This pathway program prepares students to deal with the academic demands of undergraduate mainstream courses. The biggest benefit of joining our program is that students who wish to enroll full-time in UMass Boston and pursue their bachelor’s degree with us do not need to take the TOEFL or IELTS exam to be accepted. Instead, through our portfolio recommendation process, the faculty in our program compile the work that degree-seeking students have completed throughout their courses and in conjunction with the ESL Undergraduate Program, students are recommended to go full-time and are placed into appropriate classes for the first semester of their freshman year. Estimated course time: 15 weeks Number of hours per week: 19 hours a week (full-time) *part-time options available for U.S. citizens and residents Class Size: 20 students max.
