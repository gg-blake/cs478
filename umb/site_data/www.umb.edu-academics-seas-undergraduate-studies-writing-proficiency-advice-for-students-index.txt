These policies apply to all papers submitted in an EWRAP or WPE portfolio.  Violating this policy has serious consequences, which may include suspension or expulsion. Additional evidence may be requested as part of an investigation. Students should retain copies of drafts for the new portfolio essay until after the grades have been received. If you have any questions, please visit the Resources for WPE students page on our website to help you to avoid plagiarism.
