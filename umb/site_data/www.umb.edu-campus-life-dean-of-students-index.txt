FERPA Our staff is bound by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). When a student reaches the age of 18, or begins attending a post-secondary institution regardless of age, FERPA rights transfer to the student. Therefore, with the exception of a crisis situation, the Dean of Students Office shares information about student concerns only on a need-to-know basis to the extent permitted by FERPA. Title IX UMass Boston is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment free of intimidation, harassment and sexual misconduct, which includes relationship violence, stalking, and sexual harassment. Such conduct is prohibited by federal law (Title IX) and by university policy.
