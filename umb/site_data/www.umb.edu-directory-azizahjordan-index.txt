Degrees PhD, University of Minnesota (Lifespan Motor Control/Motor Development, Gerontology) MA, University of Minnesota (Lifespan Motor Development) BS, University of Minnesota (Kinesiology) Professional Publications & Contributions Pubmed Publication List Additional Information Azizah Jor'dan completed her postdoctoral fellowships in translational research in aging at the Harvard Medical School (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Hebrew SeniorLife) and the VA Boston Healthcare System (Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center). Her research investigates the effects of aging and age-related disease on the direct link between neurophysiology and balance control. Professor Jor'dan's NIA-funded project seeks to determine the effects of aging, type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer’s disease on the relationship between the ability to walk and stand and the associated brain activation (i.e., blood flow and oxygen levels) that occurs during these activities, and if increasing brain activation using noninvasive electrical brain stimulation will result in improved walking and standing in these vulnerable populations. Her research will, therefore, provide new insights into the control of walking and standing and provide proof-of-concept that brain stimulation can be used as a safe rehabilitative strategy in aging and age-related disease.
