Applying as an undergraduate student at UMass Boston gives you access to so many things—social, educational and cultural programs like concerts and lectures, internships and service volunteer opportunities, more than 100 student clubs and organizations to choose from, and critical support from faculty and peers in Success Communities in each of our colleges. With more than 80 undergraduate degree programs, UMass Boston welcomes your perspective (over 2,000 international students from 136 countries, speaking more than 40 languages) to those of so many others (16,000 undergraduate and graduate students from a wide diversity of  local and international backgrounds) to enhance the educational experience for all. And, despite a large student body, our classes are relatively small (averaging only about 28 students), so individual attention, focus, and achievement are realities.
