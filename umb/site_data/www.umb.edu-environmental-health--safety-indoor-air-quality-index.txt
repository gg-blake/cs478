UMass Boston's Facilities Department manages the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in campus buildings with the goal of meeting or exceeding industry performance standards regarding ventilation, temperature, relative humidity, air quality, odor, noise, and lighting. OEHS works collaboratively with Facilities to help identify, remediate, and maintain acceptable indoor air quality parameters in compliance with national standards established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). If you have questions or concerns with the indoor air quality within buildings on campus, please contact Facilities at 617.287.5450 or facilities@umb.edu.  When required, a member of OEHS will be in contact to discuss the concern and, in certain situations, perform air quality sampling to compare conditions to industry standards.
