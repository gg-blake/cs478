Dr. Zou has extensive research training in the field of skeletal muscle physiology and metabolism. His primary research interests lie in elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to dysregulated skeletal muscle metabolism, mitochondrial function and insulin resistance with metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes) and how exercise counteracts with these defects. Dr. Zou's lab utilizes an integrative approach by combining animal models, human primary muscle cells, and human biopsy samples to address these important research questions. His current funded research project focuses on: 1) Investigating the role of mitochondrial dynamics in regulating skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and exercise capacity in obesity and type 2 diabetes; 2) Investigating the effects of exercise training on mitochondrial quality control and the mechanisms behind in various disease models. The ultimate goal of his research program is to develop novel therapeutics in order to treat metabolic diseases and improve metabolic health.
