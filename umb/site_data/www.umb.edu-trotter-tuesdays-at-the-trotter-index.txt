The event takes place on occasional Tuesdays once per month during the regular semester. Scholars across disciplines interested in presenting their work in progress or recent published work or those interested in professional development related content/delivery are welcome to participate in this series. The forum is threefold in that the purpose here is to create a space to platform scholars doing research on Black communities, facilitate cross disciplinary collaboration, and provide professional development information about writing book proposals, journal articles, and writing for the public as well as sharing course development ideas and classroom experiences. We will from time to time also have writers, public intellectuals, journal editors and publishers participate in our virtual salon to discuss their experiences writing and publishing opportunities.
