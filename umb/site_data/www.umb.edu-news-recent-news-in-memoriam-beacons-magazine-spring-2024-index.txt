    Beacons Magazine In Memoriam Phyllis Kane Kelleher '58 PHYLLIS KANE KELLEHER ’58 Phyllis passed away at the age of 87 after a short period of declining health. Born in Boston and raised in Dorchester, she was a resident of Stoughton, Mass., for many years and enjoyed spending her summers in South Yarmouth. Phyllis was a beloved teacher in the Stoughton School System for more than 40 years, teaching at the Gibbons Elementary School, Jones Early Childhood Center, Dawe Elementary School, and O’Donnell Middle School. She retired as the Assistant Principal of the Gibbons School. Phyllis was a sports lover and refereed basketball for several years. She was a member of the Massachusetts Teachers Association and the Kappa Delta Phi Society. In 1963, she married Joseph Kelleher, and they shared over 60 years of marriage. In addition to her husband, Phyllis is survived by her two daughters, her son-in-law, her grandchildren, her sister, and several nieces and nephews. PROFESSOR EMERITUS WILLIAM ROBINSON Bill, professor emeritus of environmental toxicology, passed away in March at the age of 75. He joined UMass Boston’s Environmental Coastal & Ocean Sciences Program as an associate professor in 1992, was promoted to full professor in 2000, and held many administrative leadership roles during his tenure. Bill retired in 2019 and continued to be part of the School for the Environment community, conducting research and advising students. He genuinely enjoyed his chosen career and pursued varied interests in his personal life with the same enthusi- asm. Bill and his wife, Scottie, enjoyed travel, live music performances, and sailing together. They cared deeply about the development and evolution of the School for the Environment and in 2022 established the William E. Robinson Research Fellowship Fund of the School for the Environment at UMass Boston. ELLEN KELLY DICKSON ’74 After a battle with cancer, Ellen passed away peacefully at 71, surrounded by family. Born in Boston and raised in Dedham, Mass., she grew up in a vibrant and busy household as the oldest of eight, with seven younger brothers. While at UMass Boston, she held the inaugural Student Trustee position and addressed the student body at commencement. In 1975, while enrolled in the MBA program at Babson College, she met the love of her life, Henry “Chip” Dickson. They moved to Summit, New Jersey, in 1993, where Ellen served her community in several ways. She was a member of the city council for six years and was serving as mayor when Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012. Ellen and Chip became Florida residents in 2018, where Ellen joined the boards for the Beach Property Owners’ Association of Delray Beach and the Florida Coalition for Preservation. Ellen was a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend. In 2021, Ellen and Chip established the Ellen Kelly Dickson Scholarship Fund at UMass Boston. Her spirit lives on with her husband of 46 years, her immediate and extended family, and her large network of friends. ALUMNI Ann-Marie Toomey Amendolare ’60 Mary Anne Arabian ’59 Francine L.
