Program Model Student Leader Positions Participant Positions Leadership Foundations is a program designed for undergraduate student leaders to gain a well-rounded understanding of their leadership style through interactive workshops. Students will learn how to set and achieve goals and will also engage in on- and off-campus events in order to gain a greater sense of citizenship and community involvement. Workshops take place in the Spring semester, bi-weekly on Mondays from 2:00 - 3:00 PM . Program Model The program will follow the Social Change model for leadership development and the Social Action, Leadership, & Transformation Model, which examines leadership through three perspectives, with seven main elements. The three levels are Individual, Group, and Community. Within the Individual level, the three values focused on are Consciousness of Self, Congruence, and Commitment. Within the Group level, the three values are Collaboration, Common Purpose, and Controversy with Civility. And finally, within Community, the value is Citizenship. The program will utilize the book "Leadership for a Better World" as well as the Social Action, Leadership, & Transformation (SALT) Model white paper to teach students the different perspectives and values.
