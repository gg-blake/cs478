She begins with the notion of the cyborg, already a biological and machine assemblage, and creates photo-based collages to provide experimental conceptions of posthuman feminism and gender. Collage and photo-montage are art forms which have historically challenged or disrupted cultural norms and are one aspect of the diverse legacy of feminist art practice. The works from the ongoing series, Situated Becomings, begin a conversation on redefining gender in our posthuman era. Currently, she is a Professor of Art at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where she teaches all levels of photography. Hart's artwork has been exhibited in many venues across the United States and internationally, including Soho 20 Gallery in New York, the Mobius Gallery in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Ansi Gallery in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. http://www.margarethartart.com UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
