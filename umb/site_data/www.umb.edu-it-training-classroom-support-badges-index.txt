Think of it like merit badges for boy scouts or girl scouts, or an achievement in a video game, as an award for meeting a goal in a certain area. You can collect these credentials from many different organizations to vouch for your skills, and share your successes to potential employers by including in your LinkedIn profile or resume, or just brag on Twitter, Facebook, etc. Learn more about Digital Badges Receiving and Sharing a Badge If you are awarded a badge, you will be notified by email from the badge issuer. UMass Boston IT Services uses the badgr.com service, when you are issued a badge from us, look out for an email from the address: "Badgr <noreply@badgr.com>" and the subject line: "Congratulations, you earned a badge!". Once you get one, read Badgr's instructions on sharing badges to LinkedIn, Social Media, and other locations. Want to Issue Your Own Badges?
