In order to complete the program in five years, students will be expected to complete most, if not all, of the academic requirements for their undergraduate degree by the end of the first semester of the senior or fourth year. Delays to this timeline may impact eligibility for Financial Aid. It is suggested that students begin taking graduate courses toward the master’s degree no earlier than the first semester of the junior or third year. AMP participants may receive up to a maximum of 18 Advanced Standing credits to reflect the graduate coursework successfully completed as an undergraduate, reducing the total number of courses required to complete the master’s degree. A minimum of 12 credits must be completed during the time that the student is registered as a graduate student. Curriculum plans and courses of study may vary by program. We recommend you consult the Graduate Program Director of your program of interest for more information. In the semester during which the undergraduate requirements are completed, including the overall 120 credit minimum, AMP students should apply for graduation to earn the bachelor’s degree. When the bachelor’s degree is awarded, students will matriculate as a graduate student. Financial Aid Despite taking some graduate level coursework, AMP students pay undergraduate tuition and fees, as long as at least half of their coursework each semester is at the undergraduate level. AMP students will be charged graduate tuition after they matriculate as a graduate student, upon completion of 120 credits and all undergraduate requirements and awarding of the bachelor’s degree. AMP students’ undergraduate financial aid eligibility will be determined based on their enrollment and remaining undergraduate degree requirements. To maintain eligibility for undergraduate financial aid, accelerated master’s students must be taking credits that will count toward their undergraduate degree and credit requirements. Students must enroll in at least six credits that count toward their undergraduate degree requirements in order to borrow federal loans. Once a student matriculates as a graduate student, they will be eligible for funding opportunities available to traditional master’s students. Though graduate students are not eligible for need-based grants, they may be eligible for federal student loans and other external scholarships. Limited research assistantships and funding opportunities may be granted by individual programs. Contact your program of interest or the Financial Aid office for more information. Logistics Most AMP students begin taking graduate coursework in their final year of undergraduate study. They typically begin the semester after they reach 72-96 credits and are on track to complete 120 credits and all undergraduate requirements within the next academic year. Honors College students typically begin in their junior or third year after they have earned 60-72 credits. Completed credit requirements can vary by program - please reach out to the Graduate Program Director of your program of interest for more information. Students move to graduate student status when they have completed all UMass Boston undergraduate degree requirements and the bachelor’s degree has been awarded. Undergraduate students who wish to leave the program before matriculating as a graduate student are still eligible to receive their bachelor’s degree once they have earned 120 credits and fulfilled all undergraduate degree requirements as outlined in their degree audit. If a student intends to continue with the master’s degree and needs to take time off before beginning the final year of graduate work, they may defer graduate matriculation for up to one year. After this time, students lose their advanced standing in the program and are responsible for earning the full number of credits for the master’s degree, working with the Graduate Program Director to determine appropriate substitutions for the classes taken while an undergraduate student. AMP students are awarded two degrees. Students who entered an AMP before Spring 2022 will have both degrees awarded together after all requirements for the master’s degree are complete. Students entering an AMP in Spring 2022 or after will matriculate into the graduate program after the bachelor’s degree is awarded.
