That learning must account for systemic oppression, power and privilege, and culture and identity. Accordingly, the following five broad, division-wide student learning domains define and describe the co-curricular learning that takes place through the programs, activities, and services offered by Student Affairs to give students the opportunity to learn and grow in service of social action, transformation, personal development, and wellness.
