CSR has the capability to do large- and small-scale surveys by any mode -- in-person, telephone, mail, or web. CSR typically undertakes 30 to 50 small or large projects annually. Each project at CSR, whether initiated by a staff research or contracted by an outside researcher or organization, is overseen by a senior staff member who is responsible for both the substance of the project as well as budget concerns.
