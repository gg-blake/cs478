Our inspections occur on a semiannual basis, in March and September, and are conducted by members of the IACUC. The IACUC follows the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the inspection checklist developed by OLAW to help manage the inspection process. Several aspects, including but not limited to the following, are reviewed during laboratory inspections: Training of individuals in the laboratory The storage and expiration dates of pharmaceuticals Appropriate euthanasia methods Personnel and animal safety issues Appropriate record-keeping General laboratory maintenance Any deficiencies identified during an inspection are classified as minor or significant and a reasonable and specific corrective action plan and schedule are provided to the PI. The IACUC will work with the PI through the corrective action plan to ensure compliance is accomplished. In addition to this process being a regulatory requirement, our IACUC aims to keep the semiannual evaluation relevant, engaged, and constructive to ultimately improve our animal care and use program.
