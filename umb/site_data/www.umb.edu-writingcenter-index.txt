We provide free services for undergraduate and graduate students to support their academic and professional writing at any stage of the writing process. We offer individual writing consultations in person and online where we work collaboratively with writers and provide feedback on any writing, from class essays to cover letters to theses and dissertations to manuscripts for publication and anything in between. We also facilitate writing groups, writing retreats, class visits, workshops, and collaborations with faculty members and departments to support the teaching of writing. Our Locations: We have two locations. The services at these locations are the same and both are staffed by the same consultants. Our in-person 45-minute appointments and drop-in hours take place at these locations. When you make an appointment, check your confirmation email to make sure you go to the right location. When making an appointment, you can choose to work with a consultant in person or online. Main Location: Campus Center, first floor, room 1300. We're located at the end of this room. Once you come into room 1300, keep going until you reach a set of glass doors. Our location is past these glass doors. There are signs located throughout room 1300 to guide you. Satellite Location: We also have a satellite location in Wheatley Hall, sixth floor, room 48. We use the satellite for our evening hours. This location tends to be a bit quieter than our main location.
