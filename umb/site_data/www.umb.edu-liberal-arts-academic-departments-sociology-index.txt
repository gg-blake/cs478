Sociologists focus on: Individuals at all stages of the life course, from childhood to old age All types of groups, including family, peers, small groups, and organizations Diverse social contexts, including schools, communities, cities, and entire societies Sociological investigations draw from a large toolbox of research methods and diverse social theories to answer questions about the causes of crime, the course of illness, the bases of social conflict, the effects of inequality, the meaning of modernity, and other issues. Learning sociological methods and theories and conducting original research challenges you to improve your understanding of social phenomena like homelessness, immigration, child abuse, mental illness, job satisfaction, legal processes, and even your own life course. Our faculty members reflect these diverse interests, with particular emphases in the areas of political sociology, race/ethnicity, health, crime, immigration, research methods and social theory, all underscored with an overarching commitment to improving social policy.
