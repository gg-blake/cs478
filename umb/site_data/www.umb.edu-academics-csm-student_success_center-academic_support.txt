LA and SI activities are led by advanced undergraduates who have successfully completed the course. In consultation with the course instructor, the Learning Assistants and the SI leaders emphasize important concepts from the lecture and facilitate group work for students to gain a deeper understanding of the material. While Learning Assistants (LAs) offer direct support in the classroom, SI Leaders host additional peer-lead SI sessions. Any student enrolled in the class (regardless of section) is welcome to attend the SI sessions that are listed on the SI calendar (you may contact the course instructor to receive a referral for joining the zoom sessions). Learning Assistance and Supplemental Instruction activities generally starts after add-drop, each semester, up until the last day of classes.  SI sessions and LA Drop-ins do not meet during university holidays and semester breaks. Additional sessions may also be offered during finals. This program is generously supported through Oracle and other sponsors.
