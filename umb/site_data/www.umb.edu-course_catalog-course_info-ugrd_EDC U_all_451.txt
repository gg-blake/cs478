The RETELL initiative comes at a time when teachers of all students, and teachers of multilingual learners (MLLs) in particular, must be equipped to address the needs and build on the assets of a diverse and ever- changing student population in Massachusetts. The introduction of various educational reforms requires teachers to assume new roles and responsibilities in their classrooms. This course will support the professional growth of educators and the teaching and learning of all students in this time of change.
