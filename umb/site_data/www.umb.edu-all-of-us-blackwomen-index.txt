This online space seeks to be a supportive resource to address racism and anti-Blackness and its impact on the daily lives and opportunities of students of color. Systemic racism and oppression in legal, economic, education, and healthcare systems has disproportionally disadvantaged individuals who are Black and female. Therefore, this resource hub aims to provide resources for Black Women in their educational and life journeys.  It will be added to, updated, and facilitated by a partnership of several offices from Division of Student Affairs ; the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ; Career Services; the Trotter Institute ; Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department; Africana Studies Department; the American Studies Department; and the Gastón Institute . This page is the part of a series of pages to support specific student populations.
