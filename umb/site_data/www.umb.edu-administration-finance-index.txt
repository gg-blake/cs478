The mission of the Division of Administration and Finance is to provide high quality, efficient, and effective services to support the academic, research, and service activities of the university community. We recognize that the university is a dynamic organization requiring creative responses to changing priorities, demands, and conditions. Therefore, we commit to engage in those practices that will lead to the continuous improvement of services and increased satisfaction of our faculty, students, staff, and the neighborhood community. At the same time, we acknowledge our particular role as stewards of the commonwealth's resources and will implement reasonable and effective management controls to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state, municipal, and board of trustee laws, policies, and directives. We will endeavor always to communicate the bases for these controls and to apply them in a manner that is fair and equitable. To this end, we will strive to: construct and maintain safe, clean, healthful, and comfortable facilities that will promote the academic enterprise and contribute to the general well-being of the campus; provide quality auxiliary services, including food services, printing services, transportation, parking, and bookstore. develop and implement rational budgets, financial controls and reports, and purchasing policies to maintain and promote the fiscal health of the campus; and oversee efficient human resources policies and procedures to ensure that all employees of the campus receive fair and reasonable treatment.
