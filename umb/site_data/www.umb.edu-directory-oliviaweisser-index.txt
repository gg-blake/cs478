The book was a finalist for the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians Book Award and short-listed for a British Medical Association Book Award. I am currently finishing up a new book on venereal disease in the 1600s and 1700s. Although it is centered on a single disease in London, the book tells a broader story about urban life, everyday ideas about sexuality, medical retailing, and clinical practice. I also recently edited a book that provides an introduction to early modern medicine and primary source analysis. I am grateful to have received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, American Historical Association, Institute of Historical Research, and Huntington Library, among others.
