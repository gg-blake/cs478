These ongoing efforts will include small group and regional trainings with Professor O’Malley and the Forum Secretariat both online and in person, the establishment of regional hubs as resource centers that promote local practice (starting with Kaduna, Nigeria), and cultivation of leadership potential in the new and next generation of authentic peace expert who are credible, knowledgeable, intuitive, and experienced at rebuilding divided and transitional communities. Use the forum as a living laboratory for academic scholarship Through the McCormack Graduate School’s Conflict Resolution, Human Security, and Global Governance master’s and PhD programs, we are formally educating the next generation of international relations and conflict resolution specialists. With new opportunities to engage graduate students directly in the activities of the Forum, our students will learn with and from the lived experiences of the forum members, Professor O’Malley, and the training provided by the forum. More academically grounded than the Forum members, this new breed of students will be challenged to apply academic theory learned in the classroom to the real-world challenges faced by cities in transition. They will generate shared knowledge by contributing to the forum dialogue, writing and sharing on the Secretariat’s website, generating case studies for wider distribution, publishing and presenting in rigorous scholarly forums, and producing their own unique research on the forum methods. Generate shared knowledge platforms that extend beyond the Forum for Cities in Transition We will create a technologically innovative, robust, multilingual website that serves as a resource for Forum members, peace experts, academics, and practitioners. The platform will host online discussions and courses for wider learning and analysis, case studies, how-to guides, and instructional videos. With better communication networks, the Forum Secretariat can publish academic analysis and findings on effectiveness of the Forum method using data collected in comprehensive and routine formats, contribute to journals and conferences on the topic, engender scholarly dialogue and research on the development of transitional cities, and parlay experiences into intellectual scholarship on successes, failures, and challenges to resolving intractable conflicts in municipalities. Shared knowledge platforms and networks would create a community of practice in scaling, replicating, and applying the Forum method to other trouble spots around the world.
