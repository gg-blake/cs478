OIRAP surveys incoming freshmen , participates in the National Survey of Student Engagement , and collects additional survey data as needed. OIRAP contributes to institutional assessment in a number of ways. We provide consultation on the best practices and techniques for survey research and program evaluation. We design and conduct ad hoc surveys that are usually institutional level but also program/departmental level based on importance outside of our recurring surveys, for example, the Information Technology Services, the Division of Athletics and Recreation, Special Projects and Programs, etc. Office of Institutional Research, Assessment, and Planning Quinn Administration Building, 3rd Floor, Room 13 617.287.5420 inst.research@umb.edu UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
