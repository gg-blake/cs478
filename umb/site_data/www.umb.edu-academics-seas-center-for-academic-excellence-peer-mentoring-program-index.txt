Peer mentors have a profound impact on students’ academic experiences. They assist with creating community inside and outside of the classroom by sharing their own experiences with students and by connecting students in Critical Reading & Writing (CRW) courses and First-Year Seminars with resources across campus and beyond. Peer mentors are experienced undergraduate student employees embedded directly into the classrooms who work closely with a faculty collaborator to support students in engaging with course content and navigating campus services. Their role is an extension of the CAE’s services and is essential in overcoming barriers students face in finding and accessing resources. Peer mentors are also trained to deliver other CAE services, including workshops and peer coaching in partnership with their faculty collaborator as needed. Additionally, peer mentoring is a student leadership opportunity for students who want to gain experience working in direct service to others and who are enthusiastic about helping them succeed. In turn, the CAE provides mentorship and professional development for all peer mentors through a 3-credit course, ASP-301: Peer Educator Seminar. This experiential learning course is meant for peer mentors to come together weekly to discuss topics of best practices in their work with faculty collaborators and within their assigned classes. Students also consider ways in which they are valuable contributors and advocates to their peers’ educational experiences at UMass Boston.
