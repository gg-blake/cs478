It is important for students with symptoms of acute illness to refrain from attending classes to ensure the health and safety of the campus community. Students should visit UHS only for necessary medical care and not for the purpose of obtaining verification notes. "What is the policy regarding medical excuse notes?" Professors may request verification of illness from UHS; however, UHS does not issue individual "sick notes" for professors. Students should NOT schedule an appointment with UHS solely to document an illness for missed classes or assignments, as appointments are reserved for those who need medical care. If a student is seriously ill, UHS will confidentially notify the Dean of Students Office to notify them of the need for a medical absence. The Dean of Students Office provides resources for communicating with faculty and accessing additional support. Before You Get Sick Familiarize yourself with the attendance policy for each of your courses. Attendance policies are determined by course professors, and it is the student's responsibilitiy to communicate directly with professors regarding any course requirements, including attendance.
