Actual financial aid funds disburse to the student account once enrollment, residency, grade level, program status, and housing have been confirmed and all necessary requirements have been met (i.e. loan entrance counseling and/or promissory notes, etc.). When a student’s semester financial aid awards exceed their charges, the student will receive an email notification from the Bursar Office to inform the student when an excess check or direct deposit will be available. No refund check or direct deposit will be distributed before the end of the semester registration add/drop period. At the end of the registration add/drop period, financial aid awards are reviewed for students where enrollment and other key financial aid indicators differ from those upon which the student’s financial aid awards are based. Students will receive a notification from the Financial Aid Office if an adjustment has been made to their award package. Students who are eligible for a Financial Aid Book Advance as a result of anticipated excess funds will be notified by the Bursar Office. View the details of your Account Activity in your WISER Student Service Center to determine if you have excess financial aid on your account. Read step-by-step instructions on how to view the details of your semester account; including charges, payments, financial aid and if you have a balance due amount or excess aid remaining after your charges are covered. A term balance in parentheses reflects excess funds remaining after charges are covered.  If your excess is a result of loan funds, you may request to reduce or decline your loan if you do not need the amount of excess funds reflected in your account activity. Students may submit a request to cancel or adjust their loan by submitting the Loan Change Request form or by emailing their request, from their university email account, to finaid@umb.edu . For Parent PLUS loan borrowers, the parent borrower may either complete and sign the Loan Change Request form or email finaid@umb.edu from the email associated with their Parent PLUS loan application. If you have questions about your student account, the processing of a refund, or how to adjust your loan, you may chat or book an appointment with The One Stop or email theonestop@umb.edu .
