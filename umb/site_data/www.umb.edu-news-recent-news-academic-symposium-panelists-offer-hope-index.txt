Education experts for this panel included Wasserman Dean Christina Christie and Associate Dean of Public Engagement Annamarie Francois from the UCLA School of Education and Information Studies (Chancellor Suárez-Orozco was the previous Wasserman dean), Senior Advisor for Youth and Schools at the City of Boston Rebecca Grainger, UMass Boston Associate Professor Christopher Martell, Gaston Institute Director Lorna Rivera, and the Richard K. Lubin Foundation Director of Education Emily Woods. Panelists shared their expertise on building and supporting community schools, progress in current UMass Boston community partnerships, and creating anti-racist learning environments. Woods, a graduate of the Urban Education Leadership and Policy PhD program at UMass Boston, spoke to the audience about the impact of community school and university partnerships, and the influence her UMass Boston education had on her career. “I credit my time at UMass Boston for giving me the passion for this work and the ability to look at the history of community schools and at best practices around the country, while asking critical questions and keeping in mind the many social justice implications, in this, and any public school reform effort.” Woods said. Manning College of Nursing and Health Sciences Dean Bo Fernhall led the “Health and Wellness: Confronting Inequality in Healthcare” session, which explored research on cardiovascular fitness, cancer disparities, and the impact of environmental change and climate on public health from the panel of experts: Nurse Director at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Cancer Care Equity Program Lumila Svoboda, UMass Boston Associate Professor Alexander F. Medico More, and Professor and Executive Associate Dean at the Indiana University School of Public Health NiCole Keith. As part of his presentation, More discussed how to map and solve urban health disparities, and shared how other countries are tackling their own health and climate crises, all of which are important to better understand how to fight threats against public health and prevent future pandemics. “We need to stop thinking in a linear fashion with cause and effect but actually start thinking in terms of multiple causes, multiple effects creating the reality that we’re in, and that is the interdisciplinary work of public health in the 21 st century,” More said. “Using our chancellor’s own words from his inaugural address today, we need to embrace complexity, and the cyclical diversity in this case, in order to do this kind of study and prevent the next pandemic.” UMass Boston alum and Former White House Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, Massachusetts Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer, and Harvard University Professor Mary Waters took part in a discussion on climate change, “From Climate Crisis to Climate Resilience.” The panel was moderated by Steve Curwood, host and executive director of Living on Earth, who facilitated questions regarding the future of green jobs, the importance of spreading wealth and education globally, and the richness that diversity can bring to creatively and effectively fighting the climate crisis. “Change happens from the bottom up so the more we can do at the local level, the more we can grow into big ideas,” McCarthy said. “We have to put our faith in human beings, and we have to communicate. It has to be about hope, opportunity, and benefits to our families, the people we know, and our communities. That’s where the flower will grow. That’s the garden we have to nurture.” UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
