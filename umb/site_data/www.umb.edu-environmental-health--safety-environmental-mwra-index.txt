The permit requires the university to sample and analyze wastewater discharges from five locations on campus. The permit outlines in detail the analyses which must be conducted and includes metals, volatile organics, pH and others. The permit also places strict limits on amounts of materials that may be discharged . To view strict limits on amounts of materials, please click MWRA Discharge Limits . In addition to the 4 semiannual samples and one annual sample that must be drawn and analyzed, the MWRA may send an inspector at any time to draw their own samples and conduct appropriate analyses. If the university is found to be in non-compliance with MWRA regulations, the MWRA has several enforcement options (360 CMR 2.00) it may exercise, including: A formal notice of non-compliance to the university requiring immediate re-sampling Assessment of civil administrative penalties Revocation, modification, denial, suspension, or refusal to renew a permit Termination or suspension of water and/or sewer services Institution of court action for: civil penalties; criminal fines and/or criminal punishment; injunctive relief; or reimbursement of costs and/or damage resulting from the violation and/or any other judicial relief.
