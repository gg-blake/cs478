Get certified to serve as an effective practitioner who can assess, design, implement, and evaluate applied behavior analysis (ABA) programs. UMass Boston’s Applied Behavior Analysis for Special Populations Certificate focuses on providing students with the preparation to serve as effective practitioners who can assess, design, implement, and evaluate applied behavior analysis (ABA) programs. It’s for education professionals who want to hone their skills and add a certification to their résumé. Explore cutting-edge knowledge, concepts, and skills of basic ABA principles, ethical considerations, generalization strategies, and application to special populations and settings. Apply these skills to many areas — from neighborhoods and specialized schools to residential programs to serving children and adults with disabilities. Courses are offered at our Boston campus and through live interactive video at selected locations within Massachusetts and Providence, Rhode Island. The Association for Behavior Analysis International has verified the courses toward the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Behavior Analyst® examination. Applicants will need to meet additional requirements before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination. You may apply ABA certificate credits towards a Master’s in Education without licensure, or combine initial licensure in Moderate Disabilities with the ABA certificate for a master’s degree plus 12 post-masters credits. The MEd degree may be completed entirely with 15 credits of advanced post-certificate ABA courses.
