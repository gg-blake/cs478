IACUC approval will not be held up if the individual does not have these completed prior to request to be on an animal protocol. Animal Care and Use Training This training is designed to educate researchers and students on the animal care and use program including UMass Boston responsibilities and policies associated with animals in research as well as identifying hazards associated with the use of animals and how to eliminate or manage those risks. This training should be completed within the first 2 semesters of working with animals - email iacuc@umb.edu for schedule. Lab Safety Training This in-person training is provided by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) prior to the start of each semester.
