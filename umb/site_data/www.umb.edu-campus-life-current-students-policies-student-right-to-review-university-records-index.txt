The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 sets forth requirements designed to protect the privacy of parents and students with regard to access, review, or release of records maintained by educational institutions. The Act permits current or former students to review and seek to amend the following documents: permanent academic record, admissions, financial, placement, veteran’s counseling, advising and disciplinary records. Access to these records may also be granted to faculty and staff, parents of a student listed as a dependent on current Federal Income Tax returns, authorized federal or state officials auditing educational programs, and accreditation associations and records created or maintained by campus law enforcement units for law enforcement purposes. The following records may not be examined: parent’s financial records; medical, psychiatric, or psychological records; personal files of faculty or administrative personnel; law enforcement records held by law enforcement officials. Directory information may be released to third parties without the written consent of the student, provided the student has been given the opportunity to withhold all such disclosure. Directory information may include the student’s name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, dates of attendance, most previous school attended, class schedule, class rosters, participation in recognized activities or athletics, height and weight of athletes and degrees and awards conferred. Procedure for gaining access to records: a request by a student for access to a record is made in writing to the office that maintains that record. Within 45 days the office must inform the student when the record will be available. Every office is also obliged to tell students, at their request, who else has had access to the record and why. The academic record is the only permanent record and is maintained in perpetuity. The University Health Service retains medical records for 30 years. Admissions records for all applicants must be held for three years. If a student requests a copy of any part of his or her education record, either for personal use or for release to a third party, the student shall incur the cost of copying not to exceed $5.00.
