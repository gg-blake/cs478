What is academic work? Academic work encompasses every situation where educational information is learned and shared. It includes activities like: Doing research Teaching Giving talks Attending conferences Completing assignments Writing articles and essays Taking tests Creating and managing library collections Providing access to information Producing and performing art [Source: CAUT] What is academic integrity? The International Center for Academic Integrity (ICAI) defines academic integrity as “a commitment to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility.” The ICAI states, “These five values, plus the courage to act on them even in the face of adversity, are truly foundational to the academic endeavors of teaching, learning, and research...When the fundamental values are embraced, utilized, and put into practice they become touchstones for scholarly communities of integrity.” Academic integrity is essential to uphold within all classrooms, in the many spaces where academic work is carried out, and in our local and global communities. Students are expected to adhere to the Student Code of Conduct, including policies about academic integrity, as written in the University of Massachusetts Boston Graduate Studies Bulletin, Undergraduate Catalog, and relevant program student handbooks.
