Antivirus tips for prevention and protection Do not open any files attached to an email from an unknown, suspicious or untrustworthy source. Please exercise common sense. Do not answer any emails asking for sensitive or personal information. No systems administrator will ask you for your password or any other sensitive information. Do not open any files attached to an email unless you know what it is, even if it appears to come from a friend or someone you know. Some viruses will replicate themselves and spread through email. Confirm that your contact really sent an attachment, if you think that the subject or content looks suspicious. Do not open any files attached to an email if the subject line is questionable or unexpected. Do not download any files from strangers. Do not click on any offer that claims you might be a winner. Exercise caution when downloading files from the Internet. Ensure that the source is a legitimate and reputable one. Verify that an antivirus program checks the files on the download site. Update your antivirus software regularly. You can schedule your computer to do this automatically. You should also keep your spyware and malware protection up to date. Running once and forgetting about the software is as bad as not having it on the computer! Back up your files on a regular basis. If a virus destroys your files, at least you can replace them with your backup copy. You should store your backup copy in a separate location from your work files, one that is preferably not on your computer. Also periodically check your backups to make sure that they are still a good copy. When in doubt, always error on the side of caution and do not open, download, or execute any files or email attachments. One mistake can cost you hours or years of lost work!
