After completing the UTeach program, alumni who are out teaching are still connected with UTeach Boston.  Faculty continue to provide educational support to alumni as they begin their official teaching career.  Along with support on teaching, each alumnus also gets a box of materials from UTeach delivered right to their classroom.  The materials include chalk, markers, rulers, scissors, and folders, which are items not often provided by schools. As the program grows, the amount of UTeach students completing their practicum each semester grows as well.  In the next school year, at least five more prospective teachers are planning on graduating from the UTeach program.
