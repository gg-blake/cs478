Additional Information Dr. Roemer's research focuses on how people understand, react to, and cope with intense emotional reactions in ways that either promote or inhibit their well-being. She explores this in the context of stress and anxiety disorders, and, with her doctoral students, she explores the relevance of cultural and contextual factors in these phenomena, with a focus on helping people thrive in the face of discrimination and racism.  In collaboration with Dr. Sue Orsillo, Dr. Roemer has developed an acceptance-based behavior therapy for generalized anxiety disorder that incorporates mindfulness-based  strategies.  Her recent work in this area focuses on adaptations of this intervention, health promotion, and prevention and intervention efforts with people from marginalized and underserved backgrounds, as well as dissemination and training.
