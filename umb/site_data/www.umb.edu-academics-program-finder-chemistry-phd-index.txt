Pursue the highest level of academic achievement in chemistry and become an accomplished scientist. UMass Boston's Chemistry Department offers a comprehensive Doctor of Philosophy degree, dedicated to cultivating creative and conscientious scientists. The department offers educational opportunities in six doctoral tracks: Biological Chemistry, Chemistry Education Research, Green Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Physical/Analytical Chemistry, with a special emphasis on interdisciplinary research. Students immerse themselves in research labs early in the program and tailor their academic plan in accordance with their research interests. Students are required to complete 60 credits of coursework, consisting of two core courses, three elective courses, a graduate seminar course and a dissertation research course. The set of core courses is dictated by the student’s track. In addition, the department’s emphasis on Green Chemistry permeates the curricula of all of its doctoral tracks. Our PhD program culminates in a public defense of the student’s research and the publication of the dissertation. The specialty of the Department is in the field of Green Chemistry, and we are proud to be the first school in the country to offer a doctoral degree via the PhD in Chemistry/Green Chemistry Track. It focuses specifically on preparing chemistry doctoral students to direct, design, and implement chemical research using strategies that reduce or eliminate the impact on human health or the environment. It provides experiences, tools, and skills needed for conducting research in a more environmentally sustainable fashion. The strength of the green chemistry curriculum lies in its overlapping interdisciplinary themes of research. Our faculty is committed to research designed to benefit society, and this emphasis is reflected in our course selections at all levels of education. Start Your Application Chemistry PhD (Biological Track) Students in the Biological Chemistry PhD track are required to take one core course, two core biological chemistry track courses, three elective courses, and at least six credits of Graduate Seminar and twenty credits of dissertation research. Of the three elective courses, one must be in the Chemistry Department, whereas up to two can be from other departments upon approval from the student's dissertation committee. View the Curriculum Chemistry PhD (Chemistry Education Research Track) Students in the Chemistry Education PhD track are required to take one core course, two core chemistry education track courses, three elective courses, and at least six credits of Graduate Seminar and twenty credits of dissertation research. Of the three elective courses, one must be in the Chemistry Department, whereas up to two can be from other departments upon approval from the student's dissertation committee. View the Curriculum Chemistry PhD (Green Track) The Green Chemistry Track in the Chemistry PhD Program is the first such program in the world. Students obtaining a degree from this program will be prepared for conventional chemistry jobs in industry, government, and academia. In addition to traditional training in the chemical sciences, required and elective courses in the Biology Department and School for the Environment provide graduates with the tools and experience to assess human impact on health and the environment. Green chemistry involves an ecologically sustainable view of chemical research, development, and manufacture. Toxicological understanding and environmental fate are necessary components to understanding the entire "molecular life cycle" of any commercial endeavor. Typically, universities and academic departments lack the appropriate personnel and facilities to pursue a program of this kind. The unique complement of Chemistry, the School for the Environment, and Biology Department faculty has allowed the University of Massachusetts Boston to create such a program. View the Curriculum Chemistry PhD (Inorganic Track) Students in the Inorganic Chemistry PhD track are required to take one core course, two core inorganic chemistry track courses, three elective courses, and at least six credits of Graduate Seminar and twenty credits of dissertation research. Of the three elective courses, one must be in the Chemistry Department, whereas up to two can be from other departments upon approval from the student's dissertation committee.
