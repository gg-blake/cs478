Our mission of providing the life-changing opportunity of a college education remains as strong today as in 1983 when Urban Scholars began. From an original enrollment of fifteen academically talented Boston public high school students, we have served nearly 1,500 students. Graduates of the program have a college enrollment rate of 98 percent, compared to 57 percent for their peers from non-exam Boston high schools.
