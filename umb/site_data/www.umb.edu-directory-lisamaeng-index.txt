Her primary research questions are: (1) Do stress and fear engage divergent neurocircuits between the sexes to cause sex-specific changes in cognition and behavior? (2) How do gonadal hormones modulate sex-specific effects of stress on cognition and behavior? and (3) Can the gonadal hormones linked to sex-specific stress effects on cognition and behavior be targeted or manipulated for clinical treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders? She uses a rodent model and a variety of behavioral paradigms to address these questions with the aim of identifying clinical targets for more effective, sex-specific treatment of mental illness.
