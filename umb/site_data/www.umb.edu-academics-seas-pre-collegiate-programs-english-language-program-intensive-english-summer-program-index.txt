Application Deadline for Summer 2024: March 29th for new international students May 17th for transfer and resident students Our Intensive Summer English Program is designed for all students (residents and international students) who wish to improve their academic English language skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Our intensive courses, which range from the pre-intermediate to advanced levels, are carefully tailored to train students to not only learn and perfect their English skills, but also deal with the academic demands of undergraduate and graduate mainstream courses. In addition to the intensive courses, weekly field trips to sites of cultural and historical interest in Boston and its surrounding areas complement regular classes and serve as an immersion tool for our students to practice the language in real settings.
