(Mandatory pass/fail courses do not count toward this limit.) Please view the academic calendar for deadline information. Please note : This is an Undergraduate policy only. Graduate students do not have the option to take a course pass/fail. The requirements of your college, major, or program may not permit you to take certain courses pass/fail. Be sure to check with your college or program BEFORE you select the pass/fail option. You can file for the pass/fail option through WISER at any time after your initial registration until the deadline. Select Pass Fail Revoke Pass Fail If you receive a grade of “F,” it will count as a failure and against your cumulative average. If you successfully complete the course, you will earn a grade of “P” and the course will be counted toward your graduation requirements, but it will not affect your cumulative grade point average. Undergraduate students may take one course each semester on a pass/fail basis.  Only one course during the summer is allowed to be taken using the pass/fail grading.(Mandatory pass/fail courses do not count toward this limit.) There is a maximum of eight classes allowed to be taken using the pass/fail basis. You cannot cancel a pass/fail choice after the deadline. Your professor cannot see if you selected the pass/fail option when they grade. Any grade D- to A will convert to a P grade. Course Withdrawal Option Our Withdrawal Policy If you do not attend classes, you will not be withdrawn automatically. Unless your instructor takes attendance and submits a grade of “NA” to the Registrar’s Office, you will receive a grade of “F” for the course. To withdraw from a course, use the WISER system and follow these instructions . You may withdraw from any individual course. If you do so you will be given a grade of “W”, which will remain on your record but will not affect your cumulative grade point average. You may register for the same course in another semester. You cannot withdraw from a course after the deadline. You can however, withdraw from the entire semester up until the last day of the semester See University Withdrawal Policy for more information. There are no refunds for individual course withdrawals.
