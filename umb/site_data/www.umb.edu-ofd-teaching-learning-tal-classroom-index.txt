These techniques can transform students from passive receivers of content to engaged makers of knowledge and in the process transform an instructor’s understanding of teaching and learning as dynamic, reciprocal processes. TAL will still include training for specific active learning classrooms on campus; however, its focus will widen to include innovative techniques generally applicable to UMass Boston classrooms, whether one is teaching a large lecture, a small discussion class or the many options in between. The program facilitator will be Brian White, Associate Provost for Student Success. Focus on Teaching Large Classes The number of large-format (more than 70 students) classes is increasing on campus. These courses provide particular challenges and opportunities for teachers. Please consider applying if you would like to: Understand how active learning techniques can be used to support diverse learner Engage students in exciting classroom environments Move your students from simply reciting content to application and innovation Collaborate with faculty from across the University Learn about active group work, team building and student-centered learning And for large enrollment courses, learn peer instruction techniques. How the program works: Six to twelve TAL Fellows will participate in a weekly seminar starting in Fall 2019 . TT and NTT faculty are encouraged to apply. Seminar meetings will consist of workshop sessions, deep discussions, guest presentations, as well as visits to active learning classrooms including the TAL and ALC classrooms, and will train faculty in effective uses of them. Fellows will receive a stipend for participation and will be encouraged to present their work at a future University Conference on Teaching, Learning and Technology. Fall 2020 applications coming soon!
