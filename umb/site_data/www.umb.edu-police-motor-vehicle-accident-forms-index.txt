Motor Vehicle Crash Info Any motor vehicle crash that occur within the bounds of the University of Massachusetts Boston will be investigated by the University of Massachusetts Boston Police Department. M.G.L. Chapter 90, Section 26 requires a person who was operating a motor vehicle involved to complete the Motor Vehicle Crash Operator Report form in a crash in which any person was killed, any person was injured or there was damage in excess of $1,000 to any one vehicle or other property. Report with the Registrar within 5 days after such crash (unless the person is physically incapable of doing so due to incapacity). The person completing the report must also send a copy of the report to the police department having jurisdiction on the way where the crash occurred. If the operator is incapacitated but is not the vehicle's owner, the owner is required to file the crash report within the 5 days based on his/her knowledge and information obtained about the crash. The Registrar may require the owner or operator to supplement the report and he/she can revoke or suspend the license of any person violating any provision of this legal requirement. A police department is required to accept a report filed by an owner or operator whose vehicle has been damaged in a crash in which another person unlawfully left the scene even if damage to the vehicle does not exceed $1,000. Please note: If you are involved in a motor vehicle crash, you must submit a crash report within five days to the Registry of Motor Vehicles , your insurance company, and the Police Department whose jurisdiction the accident occurred in.
