American Studies Founder’s Prize The American Studies Founder’s Award is given to a graduating senior in American Studies who has done outstanding work in his/her American Studies major, as attested to by two or more faculty who teach regularly in the program. Recipients must have an excellent academic record in the major and meet one of the following requirements: 1) submission of two short papers, or one substantial research paper, that demonstrate competence with two of the program’s required modes of analysis (historical, literary, ethnographic, media); or 2) submission of a paper that explores the applicability of American Studies theory, knowledge, or modes of analysis to a practical setting, such as an internship, tutoring or teaching, community service, social action, or political action. (Given to undergraduate student only). Careers Careers for UMass Boston American Studies Majors Career opportunities for students of American Studies are as diverse and multifaceted as the program itself. Students interested in law, government, museum and library work, media and communications, business (national and international), teaching (elementary through university), and public and social services have benefited from majors and minors in the study of American society and culture. Graduates of our program have gone on to graduate programs in law, library science, international relations, history, and American Studies; they have careers as high school and college teachers, lawyers, real estate consultants, business managers, archivists, tour guides, and administrators of educational, state and federal government programs, including the Metropolitan District Commission, the Food Stamp Program, and the National Park Service. A double major, or a minor in American Studies, is particularly useful for students who want to enrich and broaden their majors in Anthropology, Art, English, History, Management, Political Science and Sociology. From data gathered at institutions that have kept track of their majors, we know that many American Studies graduates have found employment in the public sector. Some of our own past graduates have worked for the National Park Service, the Food Stamp program, as legislative aides, in museums, library, and historical societies, as well as the foreign service and the international departments of private companies who staff require expertise in "telling America's story."
