ISSN: 2795-6644 “Is Sylvan’s Box a Threat to Classical Logical Norms?” (2012) Florida Philosophical Review . Additional Information My overall pedagogy is inspired by bell hooks’ idea that education is a tool of liberation, that education is not only a means of sharing information but is a means of helping people grow and overcome the personal and social barriers they encounter in life ( Teaching to Transgress ). This is especially important to me since college did not seem like a real possibility until I was 27 and I finally enrolled in a community college while working full time. I think effective teaching goes hand in hand with research, so I maintain research projects in metaphysics and philosophy of language. I also work on issues at the intersection of social ontology and social philosophy. In addition to philosophy, I enjoy criticism, literature, and poetry.
