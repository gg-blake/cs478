First Year and Senior students take the survey to share their experiences as undergraduates. NSSE results serve as a key element of institutional assessment and program improvement at UMass Boston. It helps measure how UMass Boston is doing compared to other similar institutions and identifies areas where we can improve the quality of student life on campus. The survey takes 15 minutes. NSSE sends a survey link directly to eligible student’s UMass Boston email account. The results are confidential. No individually identifiable responses are shared; only group results are reported. Those students that complete the survey are entered into a lottery for $25 bookstore gift cards (20 winners). For more information about the survey, please visit the NSSE website .
