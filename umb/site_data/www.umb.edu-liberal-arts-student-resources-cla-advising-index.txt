College of Liberal Arts Advising Mission Statement CLA Advising teaches and empowers undergraduate students with majors in the College of Liberal Arts to become active participants in their education and engaged members of the University community, within the College of Liberal Arts and beyond. We work collaboratively with our advisees and with faculty advisors, providing information, support, and guidance, as we encourage students to make informed academic decisions, take advantage of the university’s educational opportunities, and assume ownership of their academic choices. Through the advisor/advisee partnership, students are able to identify and develop educational plans that are meaningful and relevant for their academic purposes, and to connect those plans to their individual life goals.
