    Office of Communications Over three dozen UMass Boston current and past researchers appear on the 2022 Stanford-Elsevier list of the world’s most-cited scholars. Being included on this list is a powerful testament to the reach and impact of the research taking place at the university. To create the publicly available database of top-cited scientists, a group of scientists at Stanford University developed a ranking method based on standardized citation metrics that considers total author number and author position. Modern academic research is highly collaborative, though authors in the first and last positions typically indicate the researchers who led or supervised a published research project, respectively. Originally published in the PLOS Biology Journal in 2020, Elsevier released the most recent update of the ranking in November 2022 . Biology Professor Liam Revell said, “The large number of UMass Boston faculty on this list is a strong reflection of our identity as the leading public research university in metropolitan Boston, and should be a source of pride for our institution.” Current UMass Boston researchers in the 2022 overall top 100,000 globally most highly-cited scientists: Biology Liam J.
