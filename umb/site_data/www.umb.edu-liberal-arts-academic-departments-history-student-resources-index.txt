Many history graduates make direct use of the knowledge gained in their undergraduate major in professions such as teaching, archival and museum work, journalism, and government, especially the Foreign Service. A larger group of history majors makes more general use of the skills gained in history courses. The ability to gather, analyze, and summarize evidence and then draw conclusions about one’s findings is valuable preparation for a wide variety of careers. For example, history is one of the most popular majors for students for students entering law school. Others do well in graduate programs as diverse as management and medicine. Some go directly into training programs at banks, other businesses, and a wide range of public and private institutions. A major resource for planning a career is the Office of Career Services in the University Advising Center -- telephone: (617) 287-5519. The Center has a Resource Library with a number of books and pamphlets of interest to history majors. Two books of particular interest to students beginning their career planning process are, Career Choices for Students of History and Lawrence A. Malnic, What Can I Do With a Major In ? The Office of Career Services also assists with career guidance and graduate school planning and application. Of particular importance to many history majors is the pre-law advisor, who will guide students through the law school application process. The Office of Career Services also helps with placement in jobs. History faculty can also be of help in post-graduate planning, particularly with students who hope to attend graduate school in history. Students planning to attend graduate school in any field will need letters of recommendation. In approaching professors for such letters, it is helpful to have a brief biographical statement and a university transcript, as well as a paper you may have written in that professor’s course.
