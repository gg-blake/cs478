The structural and electronic properties of transition metal organometallic complexes are discussed using ligand field theory to develop and advanced understanding of transition metal-ligand bonding interactions. Characteristic transition metal mediated chemical transformations are discussed and their application in catalytic transformations or organic substrates and small molecule activation (proton reduction, water oxidation, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction) discussed.
