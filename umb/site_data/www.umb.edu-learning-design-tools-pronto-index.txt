Book a Consult How to Use Pronto Promote Engagement with Pronto Here are some tips for using Pronto: Encourage students to post questions using the Pronto chat tool. Check the chat often to identify student questions and areas of interest or confusion. If you find this difficult ask a student (or two) to take on special roles as “chat monitors” to keep track of questions or chats that you may miss while presenting. Use chat to engage students in discussion. Pause often during a lecture to ask a question and invite students to answer or comment – have these planned into your lecture!
