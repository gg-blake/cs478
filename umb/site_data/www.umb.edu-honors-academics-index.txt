The senior thesis/final project, normally undertaken in the student’s major department, which earns the student honors in the major while also satisfying Honors College requirements: The college encourages the presentation of such projects at national and statewide conferences on undergraduate research.

Learning Outcomes Honors College Learning Outcomes Honors College students will: Engage in the practice of integrating insights from multiple disciplines, and analyze connections among disciplines Learn from other students from diverse majors and colleges by engaging together in the lively interchange of ideas Appreciate that expertise and deep knowledge in a student’s major can be enriched by conversations about other areas of knowledge Become increasingly aware of current events, ethical issues, and controversies that permeate and impact multiple disciplines of study Understand that asking questions in different ways, utilizing different methodologies, and making different assumptions impacts the construction of new knowledge View complex challenges in ways that incorporate local, national, and global perspectives Engage in intellectual exploration of unfamiliar subjects, places, situations, and cultures, while being aware that deep understanding may only be achieved after significant time and thought Acquire critical writing, critical reading, and critical thinking skills, while recognizing that these skills are continuously refined Work closely and collaboratively with students and faculty Approach complex arguments by evaluating evidence from multiple sources, and draw supportable conclusions based on this analysis Invest time and careful thought into brainstorming and developing ideas for workable solutions to complex issues Build self-awareness about one’s own interests and processes of learning Apply new knowledge outside of the classroom through experiential learning opportunities (e.g. research, internships, service learning, student teaching, studying abroad) Develop and practice the skills necessary to perform independent research Engage deeply in field(s) of interest through a senior thesis/ final project that requires sustained commitment and careful follow-through Practice asking thoughtful questions – both broad and defined Identify primary and secondary sources relevant to a refined thesis statement, and generate an annotated bibliography of those sources Deliver one or more oral presentations at university, local, or national events and conferences Practice informed decision making, in contexts such as selecting courses, applying for internships and jobs, choosing thesis/final projects, and considering as well as preparing for future careers The Honors Experience Honors College Components The Honors College experience includes the following components: Taking courses in the Honors College (two 100-level courses, four 200-level courses, and one 300-level course) Fulfilling additional requirements in math and foreign language Writing and presenting a senior thesis on a long-term project (e.g. research, internship, service learning, student teaching) Obtaining personalized advising from an Honors College advisor, in addition to a major advisor Engaging in co-curricular activities (e.g. orientation activities, special events, student organizations, etc.) UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
