Preparing thoughtful and responsive school counselors to work effectively in urban schools and communities. UMass Boston's Counseling MEd / CAGS program is committed to the preparation of highly qualified School Counselors who effectively address the needs of children, adults, and families of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, abilities, and needs. Located within an urban university, the program is dedicated to the training of professionals who most likely will work with, and provide counseling and related activities to, individuals representing an urban and diverse population. Online or In Person The on-campus program offers blended courses with both on campus and online coursework. Classes meet once per week during the fall and spring semesters. Courses are typically scheduled back to back at 4 p.m. (EST) and 7 p.m. to reduce commute time to campus. Students typically attend campus classes no more than twice per week. Summer classes are delivered online, typically after 6 p.m. (EST), once per week. The online program is predominantly online, with the exception of two courses completed in-person during the first summer semester over a two-week intensive session. The Masters of Education in School Counseling (Counseling MEd) at the University of Massachusetts Boston is accredited by the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC) for the period of September 2024 through September 2032. Why Apply to UMass Boston's Counseling MEd / CAGS Program? The Counseling Program also includes training opportunities to become a Career Development Facilitator (CDF), which may lead to employment opportunities in a variety of settings that provide career coaching, counseling, and related services. Students also have the option of adding an adjustment counseling concentration to their plan of study, which requires two additional courses, as well as additional internship hours. The adjustment counseling concentration allows students to be eligible for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education K-12 initial level licensure as a school adjustment counselor. At the end of the program, you will be eligible to apply for licensure to work as a school counselor in Massachusetts provided you complete internship hours in Massachusetts. Our program meets the educational requirements for licensure in Massachusetts. Please check with an admissions counselor at csp.admissions@umb.edu to determine if our program meets educational requirements for practice in your state. Regardless, internship hours must be satisfactorily completed in Massachusetts to certify that you have completed a state-approved program.
