Limited Submissions Limited Submission Funding Opportunities are externally sponsored grants that limit the number of submissions, and may require an internal selection process. Faculty are responsible for conducting their own funding searches, tracking the limited submission opportunities that they are interested in, and notifying ORSP if they identify a limited submission opportunity for which they intend to apply. Click here for a list of Limited Submission funding opportunities. Find Collaborators Collaborative research has many benefits, such as sharing resources and experience, providing support for a larger project, and division of labor. Some funders favor interdisciplinary research teams. When creating a profile in Pivot, be sure to add key words that are relevant to your research area(s).
