Teaching Philosophy: I enjoy helping my students take their love of music to the next level so that they can express themselves fully. Besides learning how to play the violin, students in my studio develop strong abilities in other areas as well. My students learn important life skills; how to focus and problem solve, how to be flexible in their thinking—and how to balance their physical, intellectual, and emotional energies—both on stage and off. I am very thankful that I’ve been able to help my students achieve their goals. Whether we are focused on preparing for an audition, performance, competition, or working on a healthy practice technique, my overarching goals are to help students cultivate a curiosity and love of learning. What life has shown me is that music is for everyone; it can open up a world of appreciation, insight, and self-realization. The key to finding yourself in music is through music. Learning to play the violin is a journey that rewards students with confidence and memories of performances as a shared, generous, and joyful experience.” UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
