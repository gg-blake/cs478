The forum developed a similar symposium which was delivered to the entering freshman cohort in the college and is now creating an online “webinar” series which will address various financial issues facing the pre-collegiate and new college entrants. The forum has also developed a series of Financial Calculators which allows users to calculate mortgage payments, plan for retirement, calculate their net worth and enable them to track their monthly payments by various expenditure categories and compare them to U.S. national averages.
