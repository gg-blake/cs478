From dual enrollment credits taken in high school to AP or IB examinations, students are able to transfer in various forms of credit toward their degrees. Advanced credits not only allow students to fulfill various graduation requirements (saving you time and money), additional transfer credit can create space in your schedule that allows you to explore new academic interests and opportunities. Review our policies below to learn more about how you can take advantage of advanced credit. Advanced Placement (AP) Review the AP Credit Policy Chart to learn how your AP credits transfer into UMass Boston. In order to receive credit for your AP classes, you must request The College Board send official copies of your scores to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Request this when you take the exam or go to The College Board website to request to send your scores. Use UMass Boston’s CEEB 3924. A-Levels Students are eligible to transfer in credit from Advanced Level and Advanced Subsidiary Level credits earned through Cambridge International Examinations. Review our A-Level Credit Policy Chart . Advanced Subsidiary (AS) - 4 credits per subject - with minimum passing grade of D in the British System of Education.
