Additional Information Research Interests Dr. Carhill Poza’s research examines the ways social resources and social contexts shape the language learning experiences and outcomes of emergent bilingual youth in urban schools. She connects policies and practices at the school, district, state, and national level to opportunities for immigrant adolescents who are learning English to develop supportive relationships and engage their multilingual repertoires in learning academic English and academic content. Her current projects are based in Boston-area public schools and Beijing, China. Teaching Interests Dr. Carhill Poza’s teaching interests focus on multidisciplinary perspectives on second language development and education policies and practices for multilingual students. Her graduate courses are designed to foster critical inquiry about the role of sociocultural factors in language use and language learning, as well as reflexivity in teaching practice.
