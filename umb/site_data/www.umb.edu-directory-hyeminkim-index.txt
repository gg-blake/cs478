DOI: 10.1080/08838151.2016.1164166 Additional Information Hye Min Kim (PhD, USC Annenberg) is an Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Her research examines the role of communication and new media technologies in addressing public health/risk challenges and promoting health behavior. To this end, she uses diverse quantitative methods such as experiments, surveys, meta-analysis, and computational analyses of social media data while connecting the understanding of social/interpersonal influence in decision-making, strategic message design, technology affordances, and health care disparities in underserved populations. Some of her recent projects investigate the processes and effects of anti-stigma messages on increasing mental health literacy of marginalized communities. Currently, she works on using communication networks to evaluate the effectiveness of social media health campaigns.
