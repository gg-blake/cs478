The Early Education Leadership Fellows represent a variety of public, private, and community-based programs. The 2023-2025 cohort will spend the next two years immersed in intensive training in relational and entrepreneurial leadership, early childhood policy, and the science of early learning. They will also connect with and join the Early Ed Leadership Institute’s growing network of emerging and established early childhood education leaders. “We’re pleased to have this group of experienced and talented early educators in our program. As state leaders increasingly recognize the need to invest in ECE infrastructure and accessibility, it’s imperative to cultivate ECE leaders who can develop and implement solutions to the many challenges facing our profession,” said Lynne Mendes, Director of Leadership Programs for the Early Ed Leadership Institute. “I’m excited to see how they innovate to improve the field.” The PMC program at the Early Ed Leadership Institute provides early educators, directors, and early education entrepreneurs small business owners with training in relational and entrepreneurial leadership designed to foster the skills, competencies, and mindsets needed for driving change and innovation in early care and education research, practice and policy. More than 100 PMC alumni have formed a powerful leadership corps, leveraging their practical experience and leadership training to improve early care and education quality and children’s learning, and mentoring the next generation of leaders and entrepreneurs. Past PMC graduates have gone on to pursue doctoral study to advance scholarship in the field, led quality improvement efforts in their programs, sought new positions to make change on a scale greater than that possible in their prior job, served on professional advisory boards, and launched entrepreneurial ventures including the establishment of innovative models of early care and education. The PMC is supported by grant funding and Early Education Fellows are offered tuition scholarships that offset program-related costs. Courses take place online and on Saturdays to accommodate employment- and family-related responsibilities.
