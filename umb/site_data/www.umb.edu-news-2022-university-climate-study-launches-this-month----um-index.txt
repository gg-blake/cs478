    Office of Communications UMass Boston will launch a study on October 18 aimed at better understanding the perceptions of students about the campus climate. The survey of the racial climate on the UMass Boston campus will be administered by the National Assessment of Collegiate Campus Climates (NACCC). “ UMass Boston wants to hear directly from students about their experiences on campus connected to racial identity. ” The NACCC is a quantitative survey that collects data about the campus communities’ sentiments around issues of racial equity and diversity and the institutional commitment to racial equity, diversity, and inclusion, among other topics. “UMass Boston wants to hear directly from students about their experiences on campus connected to racial identity,” says Georgianna Meléndez, assistant chancellor in the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. “We hope to learn, to understand, and to respond. This data will help us work with students to create a future where everyone feels as though they belong!” Participation in the survey is voluntary and confidential. Completed surveys will be sent directly to the NACCC survey team, not to anyone at UMass Boston. The survey will take about 15 minutes to complete, and will come from the helpdesk@nacccsurvey.org address. Students who complete the NACCC survey will be automatically entered into a drawing. Prizes include gifts like university swag, earbuds, single-use parking passes, a chance to have lunch with Chancellor Marcello Suárez-Orozco, and more. Meléndez cautions that responding to statements on race and the racial climate on campus may cause many feelings needing support. She suggests students access campus resources such as the University Health Services Counseling Center , identity-related support and social opportunities , or email diversity@umb.edu to get involved in improving our campus climate.
