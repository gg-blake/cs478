Our latest report is: Asian Americans in Massachusetts including Boston and other selected cities: Data from the 2020 Decennial Census and American Community Survey . Please see the addendum here: Addendum June 2024 The Decennial Census is conducted every ten years and provides the most accurate counts of people in the nation, states, and smaller geographical areas, as well as information about age, sex, race and ethnicity, homeownership, and household composition. Please see our Decennial Census 2020 page for selected population tables. The American Community Survey (ACS), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, is a nationwide survey that collects detailed socio-economic information on a sample of U.S. households every year. The data is released as one-year and five-year estimates. Annual estimates contain the more timely information but have smaller sample sizes and are available only for geographic areas or groups with populations of 65,000 or larger. The five-year estimates are based on data collected in five consecutive years and therefore have larger sample sizes, but the data is less timely. All of our census publications are available on ScholarWorks . For more about U.S. Census Bureau, go to https://www.census.gov . To search for U.S. Census data, go to https://data.census.gov .
