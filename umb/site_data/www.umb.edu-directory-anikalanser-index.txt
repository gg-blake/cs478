Her M.A. thesis utilized a content and spatial analysis to examine the interactions between the social media accounts of spatially-oriented social movements and mainstream media coverage of their work. The thesis found that mainstream media coverage slowed significantly when the social movement’s spatial presence was less prominent even as the social movement’s activity remained constant and focused less on mutual aid and community-oriented gatherings than the movement’s own social media. Anika also brings two years of teaching experience, after pursuing an M.A. in Teaching from Relay Graduate School of Education and serving as a Learning Specialist for 5th and 6th grade ELA. During her undergraduate experience at Vassar, Anika conducted ethnographic interviews and focus groups to examine the relationships between the tourism industry, the environment and housing justice in Bocas del Toro, Panamá. Anika is excited to begin working with the CSDE, expand her research skills and contribute to a growing understanding of how to foster safe and inclusive social environments for all students.
