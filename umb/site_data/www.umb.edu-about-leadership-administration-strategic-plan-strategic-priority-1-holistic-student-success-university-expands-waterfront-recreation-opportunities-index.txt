    DeWayne Lehman During summer 2024, UMass Boston Recreation and Marine Operations reintroduced and expanded waterfront activities on Columbia Point for students and the community. In addition to continuing their signature Boston Harbor cruises , Marine Ops now offers kayaking, paddle boarding, and sailing at the Fox Point Dock, detailed on the Waterfront Recreation page . These recreational opportunities have grown out of the Beacon Wellness Initiative, including community feedback and recommendations from the Wellness Commission. They are funded by the Undergrad Student Government, Athletics and Recreation, Wellness Initiative, Chancellor’s Office, and Academic Affairs. This is a pilot initiative for the warm weather months of 2024.
