Five diverse women of color leaders who were civically active in their communities and were either in elected or appointed office or in community board positions were selected to be the first cohort of accomplished women to be part of the research fellowship. These five women represented various ethnicities, races, backgrounds, and were from various regions of the commonwealth. These five women of color leaders were selected to engage in a year-long research fellowship experience to help the Women’s Pipeline for Change determine the challenges and opportunities that women of color leaders face in attaining political positions in the commonwealth.
