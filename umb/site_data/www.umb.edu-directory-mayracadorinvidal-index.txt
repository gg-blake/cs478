			 05710 Phone: 617.287.6619 Send Email Website Biography I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in understanding how species interactions shape and are shaped by their community contexts and environmental factors. I study the ecology and evolution of species interactions using insect-plant systems and microbial systems. Area of Expertise Evolutionary Ecology of Species Interactions, Community Ecology, Trophic Interactions, Mutualisms, Herbivory, Coevolution, Global Change Degrees PhD, University of Denver, 2018 (Biology, Ecology, and Evolution) MSc, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, 2013 (Ecology) BSc, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, 2010 (Biological Sciences) Professional Publications & Contributions Selected publications (for a complete and up-to-date list, click here ) Vidal, M.C., Agarwal, R. and Segraves, K.A., 2024.

Additional Information Research Interests Interspecific interactions have a major influence on the ecology and evolution of organisms. My research is centered on understanding how species interactions change spatially and temporally and how these changes can shape community structure and the evolution of interacting species. I integrate population and community ecology, molecular ecology, genetics, evolution, entomology, and microbiology to accomplish my research goals.
