Once I started, I was so happy that I did because UMass Boston is the perfect place for me to learn what I need to in order to give help back. When I got the opportunity to move here, I jumped on it. I work at Fenway, study at UMass Boston, and I live in Charlestown. Being here is a dream come true for me. Stefan Ghelli, Psychology Major I chose UMass Boston because the music program is so amazing. I've learned how to create better tone and improve my practicing skills. I can branch out to different things rather than just the piece I'm working on. UMass Boston to me is inclusivity and diversity on campus and off campus and is the main reason why I came here.
