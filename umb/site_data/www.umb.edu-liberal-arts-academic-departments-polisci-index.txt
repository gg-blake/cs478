Politics touches on virtually every aspect of a person’s existence – from your local town hall to the United Nations. In Political Science we explore current affairs, historical studies, and theoretical approaches to formulate standards for judging the quality of political life and the performance of institutions. We are concerned with how societies are governed and the consequences for human welfare as they relate to various political structures, processes, and beliefs. We strive to contribute to a just, compassionate, and responsible political order and prepare our graduates for careers in politics and government, business and finance, law, international relations and many other fields. INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY Statement from the Political Science faculty on the unfolding tragedy in the Middle East: As scholars of politics at Boston’s only public, 4-year university, the Political Science department faculty at UMass Boston recognize the urgency of the moment in the Middle East and calls on the international community to ensure that all civilian lives in Israel/Palestine are protected, regardless of race, ethnicity, or religious practice. We condemn the killing of all civilians, the taking of hostages, and the targeting of homes, hospitals, schools, universities, and places of worship.  We call on the international community to stop the war on Gaza and provide a diplomatic and just solution to the ongoing conflict.  All people must be allowed live in peace and security in their homes, as well as have access to the basic necessities of life, including food, water, shelter, medicine, and freedom of movement.
