It is the first such program in the world. Students obtaining a degree from this program will be prepared for conventional chemistry jobs in industry, government and academia. In addition to traditional training in the chemical sciences, required and elective courses in the Biology Department and School for the Environment provide graduates with the tools and experience needed to assess human impact on health and the environment. Green chemistry involves an ecologically sustainable view of chemical research, development, and manufacture. Toxicological understanding and environmental fate are necessary components to understanding the entire "molecular life cycle" of any commercial endeavor. Typically, universities and academic departments lack the appropriate personnel and facilities to pursue a program of this kind. The unique complement of Chemistry, SFE, and Biology Department faculty has allowed the University of Massachusetts Boston to create such a program.
