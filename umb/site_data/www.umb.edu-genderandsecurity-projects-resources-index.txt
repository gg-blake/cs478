How Water Defenders’ Resistance to Extractive Megaprojects Transformed Ecuador Manuela Picq Senior Lecturer, Political Science and Sexuality, Women’s and Gender Studies, Amherst College Thursday, September 19, 2024 – 2:00 PM – 3:15 PM Ballroom C, Campus Center, UMass Boston & on Zoom Ecuador gained global recognition in 2008 when it became the first country in the world to inscribe the rights of nature in its constitution, and then again in 2023, when a national referendum voted to leave oil underground in Amazonia’s Yasuni rainforest. Yet little is known about the water defenders behind the scenes, mostly indigenous women, who have been putting their bodies on the frontlines, pushing for consultation and consent through roadblocks and legal claims. This talk tells their stories of resistance, and how their struggle for consent transformed the state in irreversible ways. Registration is now closed for this event.
