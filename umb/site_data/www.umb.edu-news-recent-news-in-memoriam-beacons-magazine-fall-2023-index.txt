    Beacons Magazine Beacons Magazine Fall 2023 NELSON YUAN-SHENG KIANG An internationally recognized scientist known for his influential research into speech and hearing, Nelson died in March at the age of 93 at his home in Boston. Born in Wuxi, China, he arrived at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955, and was professor emeritus at MIT, Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1958, he founded and until 1996 directed the Eaton-Peabody Laboratory of Auditory Physiology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Known for his passion for educating and mentoring young scientists, researchers, and clinicians, he established a PhD program in speech and hearing bioscience and technology at the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Science and Technology in 1992. Nelson was a member of the UMass Boston Board of Visitors, and he and his wife, Barbara (Norris) Kiang, have been longtime, generous donors to the Asian American Studies Program and the Institute for Asian American Studies at UMass Boston. RUTH KROCK ANDERSON ’39 Ruth died in March at her home in Naples, Florida. She was 104. After two years teaching math in the Boston school system, Ruth became a mathematician, working on MIT’s radar technology for World War II. She then joined the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, where she met and married Lowell “Andy” Anderson, a physicist from Cornell. They relocated to Washington, DC, where Ruth worked for the U.S. Bureau of Standards and their daughter Karen was born. When Andy retired to Cape Cod in 1974, Ruth became an information systems consultant and started a company making dresses for older women. After Andy’s death, Ruth settled in Naples, Florida, where she was active in the UMass Boston alumni community. During the pandemic, Ruth was featured in the national and local news for her volunteer work sewing masks. Her daughter has established an endowment at UMass Boston in Ruth’s honor. MARY DOUCETTE DUSEAU ’57 Mary passed away peacefully in April at the age of 87. She worked for the Weymouth school system her entire teaching career. Mary was a very loyal and active alumna, attending many annual Teachers College luncheons and reunions. She served on the Board of Visitors and was a member of the Boston Teachers College Scholarship Steering Committee. She volunteered at the Weymouth Food Pantry and was very active at her parish, Saint Francis Xavier Church. Mary enjoyed reading, playing bridge, watching Boston sports teams, and going to White Horse Beach with her family. Mary is survived by Paul, her husband of 65 years, their four children and their spouses, their children, and many nieces, nephews, friends, colleagues, and former students, all of whom loved her dearly.
