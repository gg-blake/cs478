One model of special interest is managed long-term care; she has also been heavily involved in consumer-directed services. She teaches policy courses in the Gerontology PhD Program and in the Management of Aging Services Program. Prior to her UMass Boston appointment, she worked for Thomson Medstat as a consultant, mostly to the federal government on long-term care issues. She also has extensive experience working for nonprofits, working at the Center for Home Care Policy and Research (part of the Visiting Nurse Service of NY) and the National Council on Aging. She has been in the National Project Offices for four Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant programs (acting as deputy director for three of these). She lived and worked in England for a time (at the Policy Studies Institute and the Consumers’ Association) and researched consumer-directed services in that country, resulting in evidence that supported legislative change in favor of “direct payments." Professor Nadash earned a PhD in public health and political science from Columbia University. She also has a master’s degree in political theory from Oxford University and an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Bryn Mawr College.
