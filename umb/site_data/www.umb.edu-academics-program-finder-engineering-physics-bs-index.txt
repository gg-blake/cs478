Earn a bachelor's that breaks down barriers between engineering and physics. Engineering physics is a branch of applied science that emphasizes both engineering and physics. It is a challenging general alternative to the traditionally more specialized undergraduate engineering curricula, offering flexible options for professional growth. The engineering physics curriculum is designed to provide a firm foundation of basic scientific principles, as well as the theoretical knowledge and skills required for specific engineering applications. The curriculum is equally suitable for students intending to pursue careers in industrial research and development, and for those preparing for graduate studies in a variety of scientific and technical areas. The basic engineering physics curriculum consists of the first two years of a standard engineering program, followed by upper-division courses equivalent to those required for a bachelor of science degree in physics. Students select a concentration of technical electives in one of a number of currently marketable areas: applied physics, properties of materials, computer science, or digital electronics. Students receive realistic, practical, problem oriented training in an advanced projects laboratory and seminar, designed with the cooperation of representatives from some of Massachusetts' outstanding high-tech industrial firms.
