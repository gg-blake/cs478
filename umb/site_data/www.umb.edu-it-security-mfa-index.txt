Your password is "Something you know," but things you know could easily be known by someone else too. The threat of sophisticated phishing attacks and password breaches means that a password alone is not enough to secure your most private information. Systems protected with MFA, in addition to needing the correct password ("Something you know"), a second factor is required for you to authorize your login attempt: "Something you have." Something you know:  Username and password Something you have: Confirm your identity by phone That's it! You're signed in! MFA is required for all users on several systems at UMass Boston. The "Something you have" for these systems is an app on your phone* to confirm your identity.
