Once a grade of NA is assigned, it cannot be changed to a letter grade. The “NA” grade does not affect a student's grade point average. The student is, however, responsible for all tuition and fees for the “NA” course. Faculty who take attendance may submit an “NA” by the designated deadline usually during the first month of the semester.
