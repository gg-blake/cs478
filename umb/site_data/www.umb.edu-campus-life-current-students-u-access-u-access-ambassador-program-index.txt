Ambassadors will spread awareness of and advocate against poverty on UMass Boston’s campus by encouraging peers to utilize U-ACCESS services. The Ambassador Program includes a 2-hour training session. The goal of the training is for participants to understand systemic poverty and the role it plays at UMass Boston, have the ability to describe all of U-ACCESS’s current services, and employ various skills and techniques to refer UMass Boston students to U-ACCESS services. The training will take place in person or online via Zoom.  Please email u-access@umb.edu. Students who complete the training will learn about what poverty really means, how government assistance is determined, what factors make individuals more susceptible to poverty, lots of shocking statistics, what campus poverty at UMass Boston looks like, how to recognize peers in need, how to talk about U-ACCESS, and how to get people to the help they need. Many interesting activities and discussions take place during each session! Upon completion of the course, participants will receive a certificate of their ambassador credentials and a U-ACCESS Ambassador Zoom Background. U-ACCESS Ambassadors will be ready to spread the U-ACCESS mission all over campus in their day-to-day interactions and through tabling volunteer opportunities!
