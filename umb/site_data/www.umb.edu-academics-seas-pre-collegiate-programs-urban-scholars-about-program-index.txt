The mission of the Urban Scholars Program is to identify and to prepare academically motivated high school students from select Boston Public Schools (ages 14-19). In particular, Urban Scholars looks to serve those who are low-income and/or first-generation college bound students, giving them the tools necessary to successfully enroll in and complete college. We provide our students with the skills and attitudes necessary to achieve their full potential through a structured sequence of after-school classes, tutoring, and summer academic courses and activities designed to build a strong repertoire of basic and higher-level skills, task commitment, and self-motivation. Our vision recognizes that the progress of society depends on developing the talent potential of its youth. We provide urban youth from neighborhood partner schools in South Boston, Dorchester, and Roxbury with the college preparatory resources they need to direct their own development, build successful lives, and assume positions of leadership and achievement. The curriculum complements the Boston Public School curriculum by helping students to develop the math, reading, writing, and reasoning skills they will need to complete school and continue their studies in higher education. Having served more than 2,100 students over the past 38 years, our Program has an impressive record of preparing Boston’s most talented students to attain their college and career goals. Over the past 5 years, 93% of Urban Scholars graduates have gone on to college and 82% of these students have enrolled in 4-year colleges. 77% have either graduated or are still enrolled. Participating high schools include Jeremiah E. Burke High School, TechBoston Academy, Excel High School, Dearborn STEM Academy, and Boston International Newcomers Academy.
