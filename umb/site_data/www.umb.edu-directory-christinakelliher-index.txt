Additional Information Research Interests The Kelliher Lab is investigating the circadian clock, the biological process that most organisms on planet Earth use to tell time. The circadian clock allows an organism to optimally align behavior with the 24-hour light/dark cycle. In our research, we use the fungal model organism Neurospora crassa as well as genetic, genomic, biochemical, and computational tools. The lab is currently pursuing mechanisms of cross-talk between the circadian clock and the nutrient environment and also pursuing gene regulatory mechanisms of a key circadian kinase.
