Course reserves are materials that faculty members designate as assigned or suggested readings for their courses. Print Reserves Print reserves refers to the Library’s physical collection of books and videos that can be borrowed for a limited period of time. While most Reserve items can be removed from the Library building, a few items are designated as needing to remain in the building while they are checked out. The physical collection is housed at the Circulation Desk on the second floor of the Healey Library. Reserves Recalls Any book in circulation may be recalled at any time from any user, if that book is needed to be placed on reserve. Users receive a recall notice which shortens their loan period to 10 days from the date of the notice. The standard $0.75 a day overdue fine begins accumulating (no grace period) if the book is not returned by the shortened due date. Electronic Reserves Electronic reserves may be available through a variety of different channels, including Blackboard and library search tools. In UMBrella, the library’s primary search and discovery tool, links to electronic library materials such as e-books and streaming videos can also be included in a course reserves list at the faculty member’s request. Availability of Reserves Faculty may choose to provide readings and personal copies of textbooks in a variety of formats, including placing materials on reserve and providing materials for electronic lending. Students are encouraged to contact their professors to ask them about the availability of their course reading materials. See Healey Library’s reserves policies for additional information.
