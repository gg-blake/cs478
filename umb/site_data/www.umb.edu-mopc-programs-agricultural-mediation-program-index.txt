The Program helps resolve disputes involving farm loans, leasing issues, wetland determinations, conservation compliance, and more. The program promotes the use of mediation and offers mediation services as a tool to prevent or minimize escalation of conflicts and to resolve conflicts at the earliest possible stage. Agricultural Mediation Mediation is a voluntary, confidential, and flexible process in which a neutral mediator assists negotiations between two or more disputing parties. It is not a determination of who is right or wrong, and decision-making power lies with the parties. Through mediation, parties can devise creative solutions, often in less time, at less cost, and with greater satisfaction than through litigation. Because the parties craft a mutually acceptable solution together, mediation is often successful in producing high quality settlements and durable agreements which help preserve on-going relationships. Mediation does not have to be an end point – there may be further exploration of rights and responsibilities through other processes. Requesting Mediation USDA agencies issuing an adverse determination offer the option of mediation to clients. Additionally, mediation for other issues involving agricultural producers can be requested by contacting MOPC. Where a borrower is appealing an adverse determination by the USDA, the borrower should request mediation immediately after receiving the notice of the adverse determination(s) to stay the period of appeal. Covered Issues Mediations involving covered issues are provided at little to no cost to producers, creditors, and other parties, as these services are mostly covered by grant funding. Issues involving USDA: Agricultural loans made by USDA or other commercial lenders Action on farm & conservation programs Wetland determinations Rural water loan programs Pesticides, rural housing, & business loans Crop insurance Other covered issues: Agricultural credit The National Organic Program Lease issues, including land and equipment Family farm transition Farm/neighbor disputes Farmers’ market conflicts Farm/municipal conflicts Farm/farmworker conflicts Farm/customer conflicts Farm/contractor conflicts Agricultural cooperatives conflicts Other issues can be mediated at low cost through the program or affiliated community mediation centers.
