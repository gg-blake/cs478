Representation matters if we are to address the long ignored racial inequity and injustice that is present in civic spaces. The pandemics we are facing in the nation and the Commonwealth have augmented the need to actively work toward equity and justice, especially for communities who have been marginalized. As the only public research institution with majority Students of Color in the region, the University of Massachusetts Boston is uniquely positioned to face these pandemics and contribute to social change. Our goal is to support the next generation of civic leaders by increasing the participation of Students of Color and other marginalized identities in the Greater Boston area. Led in partnership with the Office of Community Partnerships, Student Multicultural Affairs, & Student Leadership & Community Engagement, the Civic Action Fellowship Program seeks to engage a diverse cohort of students in local civic life. Fellows will build their civic agency and skills for collective action through an internship with community-based organizations and through biweekly workshops with community-engaged leaders. Fellows will receive a $500 scholarship per semester in the program.
