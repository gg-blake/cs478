Science and Children. 53 (1) Additional Information One aspect of Tej's work focuses on studying the affordances of integrated science-engineering experiences for elementary students, both in formal and informal settings. And how engineering provides a context for teaching and learning of science in elementary classrooms. The other aspect of her work focuses on developing a support system for science teachers. This includes working with both pre-service teachers at UMass Boston and in-service teacher partners at various public school districts in and around Boston. She has extensive experience in designing PD courses for science content knowledge development and incorporation of science and engineering practices. Teaching Design and teach following graduate courses for UMB’s urban teacher education program, and physics. List of courses is given below: EDCG 619- Designing Instruction in Science at the Elementary Level: Elementary teacher education course to prepare teachers to teach science and engineering in elementary urban classrooms EDC G 670: Math for Elementary Teachers, content and methods course for teaching mathematics to elementary teacher candidates. ECHD 641: Science and Math Instruction for All Young Children, a science and math teaching methods course for early childhood teacher candidates (Graduate level course) ECHD 441: Science and Math Instruction for All Young Children, a science and math teaching methods course for early childhood teacher candidates (undergraduate level course) EDCG 625- Creating Science and Mathematics learning environments in elementary classrooms, a course to support content knowledge development for elementary tecahers.
