Before considering private loan options, we recommend that you apply for federal, state, and institutional financial aid, including federal student loans. UMass Boston strongly encourages all students to apply for financial aid each year online . After exhausting loan opportunities available from the federal aid programs, students may consider private loan programs as an additional source of funding. Eligibility for private loans is based on credit-worthiness and ability to repay, not on financial need. Private loans may be borrowed by the student or parent/sponsor. Most private loans borrowed by the student require a credit-worthy co-signer and offer deferment of principal payments while the student is enrolled. Please be aware that interest rates for some lenders may differ based on what repayment option that you choose. The Financial Aid Office uses ELM Select , a loan comparison tool, where you can compare lenders, their terms and conditions, and apply for loans directly from the ELM Select website.

Students may obtain a Private Education Loan Applicant Self-Certification Form from their lender or download it here . The Private Education Loan Applicant Self-Certification Form requires the estimated cost of attendance and estimated financial assistance for the period of enrollment covered by the loan. Students may find this information by logging into their WISER account and clicking on the Financial Aid Center link > View Current Financial Aid > Select the aid year > Financial Aid Summary. This form must be submitted to the lender, not the school. The Financial Aid Office will not certify a Private Loan until the borrower’s file is 100% complete with the lender. Borrowers should verify with their lender that all required documents have been completed and received. UMass Boston uses ELM to certify and disburse private loan funds.
