Through these webpages, you will get to know five women of color active in politics in Massachusetts who became community researchers for one year to identify barriers, opportunities, and resources for women of color to run for office or serve in other public leadership positions. The five Women’s Pipeline for Change research fellows carried out studies that address some of today’s most pressing questions about the political leadership of women of color. The result of an innovative research partnership between the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy and the Women’s Pipeline for Change, these webpages were designed to offer resources to help women of color advance to public leadership in Massachusetts. What you will find on these pages: Key lessons about challenges and opportunities for women of color interested in politics and public leadership Inspiring personal stories from women of color leaders Suggestions for charting your own path to a public leadership position Recommendations for expanding or improving available political resources Ideas for promoting diversity among elected officials See this project in action through photos from key events and convenings Like the Women's Pipeline for Change Fellows Five women of color leaders from diverse Massachusetts communities drew upon their perspectives and experiences as research fellows in this project.
