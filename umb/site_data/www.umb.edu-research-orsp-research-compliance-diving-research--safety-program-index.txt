Individuals may become UMass Boston scientific divers by taking either USEA 106 or receiving equivalent training (e.g., AAUS) from another institution. Our mission is to ensure that sanctioned research diving conducted by UMB is done as safely as possible. We want UMB divers to get solid data and work as safe integrated research teams adhering to best practices. Diving activity at UMass Boston is regulated by our Dive Safety Board composed of a majority of active UMass Boston divers The DSB works with a university Dive Safety Officer to make sure all research is in compliance with our Dive Safety Manual and best practices for research diving.
