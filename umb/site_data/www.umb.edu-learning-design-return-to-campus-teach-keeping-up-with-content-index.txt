This PPT used screenshots of the pages from the textbook I would have reviewed and worked on with my students in person. I created series of slides that gradually revealed the answers that I would have elicited from students in person as I wrote them up on the blackboard, activities from the text book and other sources with instructions and examples, and embedded photos and videos. I would be happy to share one of the PowerPoints I created for my Spanish 101 or 102 classes with any interested faculty as well as discuss how I created it and how I used it." -Mark Schafer (Senior Lecturer, Department of Latin American/Iberian Studies) Facilitate Student Planning Communication to Prepare Students for Upcoming Content For more details on Prof. Veleva's strategies for helping students stay caught up with content, see recording from Jan 20 TEACH session "I sent weekly emails with reminders what we will be covering in class, any upcoming assignments, etc." -Vesela Veleva (Senior Lecturer, Department of Management, and GPD of MBA Program) Remote Access to Class and Labs Zoom If Needed For more details on Prof. Veleva's strategies for helping students stay caught up with content, see recording from Jan 20 TEACH session "In my classes last semester, I offered Zoom option for any student who either tested positive for Covid-19 or was sick (with a cold, flu or something else). This helped students avoid falling behind. I brought my own camera and logged into Zoom during class, if anyone had notified me that they needed to participate via Zoom." -Vesela Veleva (Senior Lecturer, Department of Management, and GPD of MBA Program) Access to Virtual Labs " SimBio virtual labs were integrated with hands on and field labs for flexibility during Covid." -HelenMary Hotz (Director of Academic Labs, School for the Environment) Access to Recordings Previously Recorded Lectures Provide access to "recorded lecture videos from last semester using Echo360." -Jonathan Frankel (Senior Lecturer II, Department of Management Science & Information Systems) Learning Design Services Healey Library, 3rd Floor Monday—Friday 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Book a Consult Now learningdesign@umb.edu UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
