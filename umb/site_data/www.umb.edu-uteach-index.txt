Teach it! UTeach Boston is a Teacher Certificate Program for undergraduates in STEM fields. Programs like this are generally completed as a master's degree, but at UMass Boston you get the opportunity to gain teacher certification while also pursuing an undergraduate major in a STEM discipline. Think of UTeach as a minor—but with the added benefit that completion of the UTeach program gives you licensure to teach in Massachusetts!
