Services Computing Laboratory (SCLab) Director: Kenneth K. Fletcher Services Computing Laboratory (SCLab) focuses on developing methods and algorithms services selection and recommendation. Specifically, SCLab focuses on capturing and including usersâ evolving preferences in machine/deep learning algorithms to improve accuracy of services selection and recommendation. Areas of research include exploring user temporal and contextual preferences from sequential actions, detecting fake likers in social media network, and improving recommendation accuracy with Knowledge Graphs. Software Verification Laboratory Director(s): Tiago Cogumbreiro The aim of the Software Verification Laboratory is improve the programmer's productivity, by developing tools and techniques that localize bugs, and enforce the correctness of systems. Our main focus is on verifying scientific codes,Â in the domain of High Performance Computing. We employ the fields ofÂ programming languages, formal methods, concurrency theory, and statisticalÂ machine learning to improve the correctness of software. Visual Attention Laboratory (VALab) Director(s): Marc Pomplun VALab studies the attentional mechanisms underlying human vision and is particularly interested in investigating how attention is controlled for efficient performance of visual tasks. The main research paradigms are eye-movement recording and computational modeling. The findings resulting from this research are applied to the construction of computer vision systems and human-computer interfaces. More specifically, there are three main areas of research that the lab focuses on: Studying Human Eye Movements, Computational Modeling of Cognitive and Perceptual Processes, and Developing Gaze-Controlled Human-Computer Interfaces.
