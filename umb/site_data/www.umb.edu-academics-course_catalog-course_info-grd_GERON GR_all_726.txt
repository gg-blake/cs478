It provides a brief survey of the scope and content of various public-use national databases used in gerontological research, as well as an in-depth examination of one of these major databases. Students are introduced to the fundamentals of statistical programming; to the use of such standard statistical packages as Statistical Analysis System (SAS); and to methods and strategies for basic analytic data file construction. These programming skills are applied to actual gerontological databases through examples presented by the instructor, as well as through a series of take-home student assignments completed by the students. In addition to class time, this course requires independent work at a computer.
