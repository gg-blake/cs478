This introduces a slightly different way of navigating from course to course but it does not change the way courses look or function. What does this mean? The new interface provides a more modern presentation of the course list on the Blackboard landing page, an easier to access navigation panel and improved consistency with the mobile app. There’s no action required on your part to prepare for this change. A nicer-looking course list Base Navigation introduces better options for accessing courses. The course list can be displayed in a block/tile format in addition to a list format. The tile format makes the course display more attractive as well as easier to navigate. Course tiles can be customized with color and imagery to make it easier to identify courses. An improved navigation bar Base Navigation also introduces a centralized navigation bar that is accessible from both inside and outside a course. This facilitates access to areas within the course as well as moving from one course to another. An improved mobile experience Base Navigation displays your course in the same way across all devices! No more confusion about hidden columns and grade calculations.
