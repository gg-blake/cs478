In 2001, an edited volume, Achieving Against the Odds: How Academics Become Teachers of Diverse Students , which focused on the pedagogical challenges of teaching at UMass Boston, was published. This collection includes chapters by faculty who have been involved in CIT and thus demonstrates the ways in which CIT's work has contributed to the teaching and learning of these UMass Boston faculty members.
