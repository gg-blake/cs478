In collaboration with Hope House, our shared goals are to increase the confidence of providers when discussing substance use with patients, develop communication skills between patients and providers, and to create nonjudgmental and positive patient-provider encounters.  Clients in recovery join students during weekly health assessment lab sessions.  Students interview clients and obtain health histories, including substance use and approaches to treatment, prior to completing a physical assessment.  Clients provide feedback to the students focused on communication skills and developing rapport with vulnerable patients.  While students report having a better understanding of addiction and improved clinical assessment skills, clients also begin to develop trust in healthcare providers.
