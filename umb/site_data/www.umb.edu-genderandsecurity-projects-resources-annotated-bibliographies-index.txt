We hope that by providing easier access to the findings of scholarly research, we can: help foster better-informed policymaking; support and inform women activists and NGOs; support innovative research by providing resources for researchers in conflict-afflicted areas who often lack access to the kinds of scholarly resources readily available in well-funded educational institutions. Some of our bibliographies address topics which are currently at the center of international policy agendas and civil society concern, such as “conflict-related sexual violence”; others attempt to help move the “gender, peace and security” agenda forward by focusing on more cutting-edge topics we think worthy of increased attention.
