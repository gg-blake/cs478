American Journal of Sociology 121(2):638–640 Additional Information Rodriquez's current research focuses on two areas: 1) How do health care workers, especially those who work in intensive care, manage the tensions and dilemmas embedded in their everyday work routines? He recent work has examined how ICU staff manage patients' family members involvement in end-of-life decision making and is currently working on a study about how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the social organization of work in intensive care. 2) How can schools and communities enhance the social inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities? To this end, his recent work with the UMB Center for Social Development and Education has looked at students' perspectives of inclusive behavior in schools and parents' perceptions of the impacts of inclusive sports programs. Rodriquez and colleagues are currently working on a study that examines how inclusive clubs at the high school level shape identity development among youth with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities. Rodriquez's prior work has examined care work in the nursing home industry and the utilization of hospice care in nursing homes. His book, Labors of Love: Nursing Homes and the Structures of Care Work , published by NYU Press (2014), showed how the fee-for-service payment system shapes nursing home care. In one respect, this system turns residents into an embodiment of reimbursable activities. The regulatory system exacerbates this pressure, normalizing chronic understaffing and work overload. In another respect, however, the system also sets the terms in which workers resist. In his work on hospice care, Rodriquez and colleagues revealed how a range of social and organizational forces shape whether a person in a nursing home will receive hospice care at the end of their life.
