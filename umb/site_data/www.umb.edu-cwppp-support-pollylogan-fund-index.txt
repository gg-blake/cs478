But only with additional help from private donors, corporate sponsors, and foundations can UMass Boston sustain excellence in such cutting-edge programs as the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy. The Polly Logan Fund will guarantee essential support for the center's efforts to deepen understanding of women's issues and prepare women for leadership. The fund will make possible: Innovative and Timely Research: The center is in the forefront of research on public policy issues affecting women, and legislators and other public officials increasingly take notice and respond. The Polly Logan Fund will enhance the center's capacity for such projects and strengthen its efforts to serve policy-makers, students, and the general public. Polly Logan Visiting Professorships: The Polly Logan Fund will attract distinguished officials, activists, and scholars to give guest lectures and symposia at the Center, enhance teaching, and involve students in scholarly projects. Our Services Our educational activities, events, and research projects are typically conducted in collaboration with many types of organizations.
