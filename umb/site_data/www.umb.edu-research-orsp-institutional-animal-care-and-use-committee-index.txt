This includes the use of animals housed and maintained in approved university animal facilities as well as studies conducted on vertebrate animals in their natural settings. In its review of proposed research activities involving animals, the IACUC observes the principles articulated in the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resource Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Once approved by the IACUC, any proposed modifications to an approved protocol require further review and approval by the IACUC prior to implementation. All researchers are asked to work in conjunction with the IACUC by following the policies and procedures and using the forms provided on this site. Please see the below webpages for additional information: Applying to the IACUC Managing your IACUC protocol Research Personnel Requirements Occupational Health & Safety Semiannual Inspections Animal Resources Core Facility (ARCF) Animal Facility webpage Animal Facility Issue Reporting Form As part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring the highest standards of care and maintenance within our Animal Research Care Facility (ARCF), we are always looking for ways to improve our reporting and resolution processes for any issues that may arise.

This form is designed to provide a streamlined and organized method for all faculty members to report any concerns related to the ARCF. Whether it's a facility issue, lighting malfunction, husbandry concern, or any other relevant matter, this form will ensure your concerns are documented and addressed promptly.
