Begin your journey toward an understanding of design of computers and their systems. Integrating aspects of electrical engineering and computer science, computer engineering focuses on the design, analysis, and application of computers, and on their applications as components of systems. Computer engineers work on projects ranging from microprocessors to supercomputers to circuit design, as well as related fields such as robotics. The Computer Engineering Program at UMass Boston is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET . Engineering is problem-solving. Engineering combines mathematics and scientific principles to solve real-world problems. Everything we use in our daily lives has been influenced by engineers: cars, bridges, airplanes, computers, televisions, and smartphones. Within the broad field of engineering, there are a wide variety of disciplines that focus on different aspects of the engineering. At UMass Boston, we currently offer degrees in two engineering specialties: electrical engineering and computer engineering.
