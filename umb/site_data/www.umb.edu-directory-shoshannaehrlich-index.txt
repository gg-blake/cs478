Dawson) J. Shoshanna Ehrlich is a scholar-activist whose long-standing interest in the legal regulation of reproduction and sexuality is woven into her teaching, scholarship, and advocacy work. Her 2019 co-authored book, Abortion Regret: The New Attack on Reproductive Freedom , focuses on how the antiabortion movement has deployed the “abortion is bad for women,” trope to argue for increasing restrictions on abortion access. Recent articles address the abortion rights of undocumented teens in federal immigration custody, the comparative decisional rights of teens in the context of abortion and marriage, and the historical inaccuracies/gaps in the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Whole Women’s Organization .
