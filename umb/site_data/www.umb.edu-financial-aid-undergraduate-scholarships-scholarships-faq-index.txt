How much are scholarships worth? Do you offer scholarships to graduate students? Do you offer scholarships to international students? I am a continuing student, why can I not apply for scholarships until I have earned 24 credits here? I have a very high GPA. Will I automatically receive a scholarship? Will a merit-scholarship awarded through this office impact my need-based financial aid Will my scholarship cover a study abroad program? 1. Does this office offer information on all scholarship opportunities? The Office for Merit-Based Scholarships manages scholarships offered by or through UMass Boston. We do not manage outside scholarships. If you are already receiving an outside scholarship, you should address all inquiries and concerns to the entity funding the scholarship (a scholarship from your high school or a local business would be an example). Checks for outside scholarships are paid directly to the Bursar's Office. Inquiries about the receipt of checks should be addressed with the Bursar's Office . 2. How much are scholarships worth? Amounts vary for all scholarships. For new students, some scholarships provide for full tuition and fees, others for smaller, fixed amounts. Some are renewable; others are one-time awards.  Scholarships for continuing students (those who have more than 24 credits at the university and apply through the process for continuing students) range from as little as $250 to as much as $4,000. 3. Do you offer scholarships to graduate students? The Office for Merit-Based Scholarships works almost exclusively with undergraduates. Fellowships, assistantships, and stipends, which require something of the student in exchange for funding, are more common for graduate study. Graduate students should check directly with their college or program director for information regarding these opportunities. 4. Do you offer scholarships to international students? We offer limited international student scholarships. Incoming first-year students should please visit umb.edu/scholarships for more information. International transfer students may apply for transfer scholarships at umb.edu/transferscholarships . 5. I am a continuing student. Why can I not apply for scholarships until I have earned 24 credits here? Once you enroll at a new school, you start fresh academically. Your academic record does not come with you, even if you are transferring from another college (credits are transferrable, grades are not). Before we can determine if you are a candidate for a monetary award based on your grades, you need to establish an academic record. We have determined that two semesters of full-time work is usually the minimum threshold on which we will measure eligibility. 6. I am applying to UMass Boston and have a very high GPA. Will I automatically receive a scholarship? We automatically review students for merit scholarships. A high GPA will certainly help you, but it is not a guarantee of an award. We strongly encourage students interested in receiving merit scholarships to complete an admissions application by the early action deadline of November 1. 7. Will a merit-scholarship awarded through this office impact my need-based financial aid? Yes, it can. This office is required to notify the Office of Financial Aid Services of all awards made. Frequently, financial aid packages include loans which require repayment. If you also qualify for a scholarship, we can often replace the loan with a scholarship that requires no repayment. This reduces your overall indebtedness. In rare cases, if you are receiving full financial aid, you may not be eligible to receive scholarship funding. This is an unlikely, though possible, scenario. 8. Will my scholarship cover a study abroad program? Your scholarship may cover a study abroad or national exchange semester if the charges are applied to your bill at UMass Boston and not the host institution. These programs are called reciprocal exchange programs.
