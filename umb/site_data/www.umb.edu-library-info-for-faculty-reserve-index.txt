Reserves Textbook Policy The Healey Library does not purchase textbooks for Course Reserves, for the following reasons: The high cost (and limited library budget), New editions frequently published, It is outside the library’s mandate, The library cannot guarantee access to students (i.e., most library-licensable textbooks are available as single-user ebooks, the equivalent of a single print textbook; print textbooks are often lost, stolen, or vandalized), and The library cannot purchase, license, or provide access to the supplementary materials. Exceptions may be made for textbooks that are of more general or permanent interest (e.g, one that might serve as a general reference work on a particular subject). This will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The library will accept personal copies of print textbooks to be place on physical Course Reserves; these will be returned to the instructor after they are no longer needed.
