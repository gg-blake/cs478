Confidential Resource Providers are available the University Health Services Counseling Center University Health Services Counseling Center . (for students); and at Interfaith Campus Ministries (for all community members); and at the Ombuds Office (for all community members). Resources for Evidence Collection and Medical Treatment A. Go to a safe place. If you have experienced an incident of sexual violence, physical assault, or another criminal act, the University encourages you to report the incident and seek both police and medical assistance. Seeking police or medical assistance does not obligate you to make a complaint to the university or take any further action, but the decision to seek medical help and gather evidence allows you to preserve their full range of available options. The University will assist any student or employee, regardless of their role in the Title IX, student conduct, or CRTIX internal adjudication process (hereafter referred to collectively as “adjudication processes”), to get to a safe place, provide transportation for medical help and, if requested, contact law enforcement. B. Preserve Evidence. Any community member who reports a crime or is participating in any of the adjudication processes is encouraged to take steps to preserve relevant evidence related to the reported incident. For example, after an alleged incident occurs or is reported preserving copies of any relevant written or electronic communications such as, but not limited to, pictures/videos, texts, and social media posts. Community members who have experienced sexual assault should try to refrain from bathing, showering, douching, changing clothes, or otherwise cleaning the area where they were assaulted until evidence can be collected. For immediate help, contact: Department of Public Safety: 911 or 617-287-1212 Medical Resources Seeking immediate medical attention is strongly encouraged when possible to treat any possible injuries. Please note that there are some medical actions that are more effective if taken within a few days after an alleged offense, such as preventative treatment for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections and diseases, evidence collection, and toxicology . Generally, one may discuss the incident with licensed medical personnel on a completely confidential basis. A.
