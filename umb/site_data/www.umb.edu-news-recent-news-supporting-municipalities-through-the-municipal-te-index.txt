    Allison Novelly, Research Analyst In 2022 the Urban Harbors Institute launched the Municipal Technical Assistance Program (MTAP) which provides affordable capacity and expertise on relatively small or short-term coastal management and planning projects. Designed to help communities advance harbor plan recommendations or address another local need identified by the community, the types of projects can include implementing programs, evaluating projects, writing grants, reviewing and drafting regulations, engaging stakeholders in decision-making processes, background research and data analysis, and GIS mapping. To date, UHI has worked with communities on the North Shore, South Shore, and Cape Cod. Projects have included developing an inventory of residential docks and piers ; mooring field mapping and reorganization in coordination with harbor dredging; and an assessment of ways to improve coordination of municipal services across a group of towns that share the goal of enhanced coastal management. If you are interested in learning more about how the MTAP program can assist your community, please reach out to MTAP program coordinator, Allison Novelly, at Allison.Novelly@umb.edu. There is no application deadline, and projects are considered on a rolling basis. The process beings with a conversation with UHI staff to discuss potential project ideas and tasks. UHI can also advise about relevant funding opportunities as needed. More information about the MTAP program and other UHI projects is available here .
