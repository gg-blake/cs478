Programs that carry a U.S. accreditation qualify for credit transfer to UMass Boston. Most study abroad programs are sponsored by an American university and therefore carry that institution's accreditation. Direct enrollment credit transfer must be discussed and approved by a UMass Boston transfer credit evaluator. Credits are awarded to your academic record at UMass Boston, but won't affect your GPA. Courses will NOT transfer from abroad without a prior approval form completed. Courses that are approved to transfer to UMass Boston will be updated in the student's record once an official transcript has been received by the Office of Global Programs and evaluated by Undergraduate Admissions. If your courses from abroad are not appearing in your UMass Boston transcript, please be sure the Office of Global Programs has received your official transcript from abroad.
