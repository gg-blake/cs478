Climate Change Climate change is forcing a dramatic transition toward a low-carbon economy, and business faces considerable challenges in developing viable response strategies. Considerable uncertainties exist concerning the extent and pace of climate change, the regulatory response, and the potential impact on markets and technologies. Different countries are adopting diverse approaches to addressing climate change that have significant business implications. The center collaborates with overseas universities in order to undertake wider international and comparative research on these topics. Below you'll find our recent research collaboration. Financialized Climate Governance: Evaluating the role of institutional investors in addressing the climate crisis. David L. Levy University of Massachusetts, Boston Rami Kaplan Tel Aviv University Large institutional investors are expressing growing concern that the value of assets, portfolios and even national economies are increasingly subject to climate risks, and so they are pressuring companies to disclose and address these risks. This phenomenon, which we term “financialized climate governance” (FCG), could potentially constitute a powerful change agent, given the primary role of capital markets in corporate governance. FCG also faces several challenges, however. The first is that many companies, especially in carbon-intense sectors, still benefit from massive externalities and will struggle to find profitable strategies for rapid transition. A second challenge is that asset managers still seek maximum returns in the short term to satisfy investors, meet their own performance targets, and pay pensions. Moreover, investors are generally unwilling to intervene in corporate operations and strategy. Third, FCG represents the privatization of governance and shifts power toward business and investors and away from environmental NGOs and governments. Government regulation and investment will be needed, however, to create the economic context for profitable low-carbon strategies. This project is being conducted in conjunction with my co-PI Dr. Rami Kaplan at Tel Aviv University and funded by two grants, US-Israel Binational Science Foundation, $202,500 over three years; and the Brown University Climate Social Science Network, $53,500 over 2 years. The project seeks to examine four questions: (1) the factors driving the rise of FCG, the actors and networks involved, and how it is different from other forms of climate activism and corporate social responsibility; (2) the role of ESG data and other metrics that intermediate between corporate climate practices and financial measures of value and risk; (3) how FCG is shifting the organizational landscape of climate action between business, finance, governments and non-governmental organizations; and (4), the effectiveness and limitations of FCG in driving real change. Environmental and Financial Performance Research on the relationship between environmental and financial performance is led by Dr. Lucia Silva Gao, Associate Professor of Finance. She has studied the effect of the annual release of Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data on market prices and the effects of changes in GHG emission disclosure on market price and risk as measured by the cost of capital. Her current research interests also include socially responsible investing, environmental and social accounting and disclosure, and financial models and incentive structures in clean energy investments.

Sustainable Organizations Research into sustainable organizations and collaborations is led by Dr. Vesela Veleva , Senior Lecturer in Management, Director of the MBA program, and co-director of the Center for Sustainable Enterprise and Regional Competitiveness. Her research and teaching are focused on examining the drivers and barriers to adopting more sustainable practices, and defining the business case for sustainability. Dr. Veleva is leading several research initiatives currently. Business, sustainable consumption, and the circular economy: This research examines the emerging business models and collaborations between large corporations and environmental entrepreneurs focused on product reuse, waste repurposing and upcycling.

Green chemistry adoption by the pharmaceutical industry: This project examines the adoption of green chemistry by the pharmaceutical supply chain, the environmental and business benefits as well as the drivers and barriers to greater adoption. Recent publications include: Veleva, V., and B. Cue, “The role of drivers, barriers and opportunities of green chemistry adoption in the major world markets,” Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry, Volume 19, October 2019, Pages 30-36 Veleva, V., Cue, B., Todorova, S., Mehta, N., Thakor, H., Padia, K., “Benchmarking Green Chemistry Adoption by the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry” , Green Chemistry Letters & Reviews, 2018 Veleva V., B.

Sustainable Industries Promoting sustainability in an industry along the triple bottom line - environmental quality, social equity and economic prosperity - is a complex development effort involving numerous global and local stakeholders. Part of this process is the development and adoption of sustainability standards, certifications, and reporting across industries. SERC faculty has engaged with various industries to provide sustainability assessment, training, and benchmarking. Sustainable Breweries Project: In July 2022 SERC was awarded a 2-year, $350,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to provide technical assistance in implementing pollution prevention and sustainability strategies and tools to craft breweries in Massachusetts. The project's overall goal is to work with other New England states to develop a uniform program for encouraging and recognizing craft breweries' adoption of pollution prevention and sustainability practices. "This grant will enable UMass Boston to support the sustainability transition of an important and fast-growing industry in Massachusetts while training business students in pollution prevention and sustainability," said Vesela Veleva, ScD, Senior Lecturer in Management, Primary Investigator, MBA director, and co-director of SERC. Green chemistry adoption in the pharmaceutical industry : Green chemistry involves eliminating the use of toxic chemicals, improving energy efficiency and preventing waste. SERC has been involved in a series of benchmarking research to assess and advance green chemistry adoption by the global pharmaceutical supply chain. Some of the recent publications in this area include: Veleva, V., Todorova, S., Bleau, K., Mohr, J., Vandenabeele, R. (2024).
