But only with additional assistance from private donors, corporate sponsors, and foundations can the university’s centers and programs continue to sustain their commitment to excellence. There are many ways to support the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy and its Gender, Leadership, and Public Policy (GLPP) graduate certificate and MPA-GLPP track programs to strengthen the center’s efforts to advance women’s public leadership and serve policymakers, students, and the general public. Financial donations help to enhance the center’s capacity to promote women’s leadership and empower women throughout the commonwealth and beyond.
