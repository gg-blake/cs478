Additional Information Research Interests: Dr. Sclafani's research takes an interactional sociolinguistic approach to examine identity construction and language ideologies. Her current project examines how political candidates construct "presidential selves" in US presidential primary campaign events, with a focus on how women candidates discursively navigate the double bind of gender and leadership through the use of personal narrative. She is also involved in a study of how return migrants to Greece from the diaspora conceptualize their heritage language and culture, and how they use different varieties of Greek to illustrate their affiliations with and attitudes toward their communities.
