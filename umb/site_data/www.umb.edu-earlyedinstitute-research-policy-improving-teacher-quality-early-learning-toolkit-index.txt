The Early Learning Projects were built on partnerships led by institutions of higher education with PK-12 school districts, and non-profit community education organizations such as Head Start, child care centers, museums and libraries. The ecological framework applied the same structural elements across the projects with goals that were broad enough to incentivize communities to be active agents in their own success. Each project required a lead institution of higher education (IHE) and at least one nonprofit community education partner in addition to at least one PK-12 district. All of the projects had a coaching component, which increased practice of authentic early childhood epistemologies. Projects with cohorts of early educators taking courses found an increase in degree completions. All of the ITQ projects created new cross-sector relationships and increased developmentally appropriate practices and children’s engagement and learning outcomes. Theory of Action / Chapters A Stone Soup[1] Theory of Action The Improving Teacher Quality (ITQ) Early Learning Projects operated with a theory of action focused on developing positive Early Childhood Education relationships between sectors and within districts and regions through collaborative professional learning experiences.  This ecological framework included Early Childhood Educators in school districts and nonprofit community education organizations such as Child Care, Head Start, Libraries and Museums, often serving the same children, and in close proximity to one another’s programs.  Higher education institutions were central to gathering the educators and leading the professional development experiences resulting in powerful cross sector relationships.  Working in collaboration, pooling resources, sharing professional development experiences, and sharing child-curriculum, increased core pedagogical and content knowledge for Early Childhood Educators and moreover, significantly increased children’s learning in all the projects. [1] The moral of the story of [Stone Soup (1968) McGovern, Ann] is that by working together, with everyone contributing what they can, a greater good is achieved than would be by working alone.
