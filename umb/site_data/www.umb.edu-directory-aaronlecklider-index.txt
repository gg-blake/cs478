His most recent book, Love's Next Meeting , explores the relationship between homosexuality and the Left in American culture between 1920 and 1960. Lecklider uncovers a lively cast of individuals and dynamic expressive works revealing remarkably progressive engagement with homosexuality among radicals, workers, and the poor. His first book, Inventing the Egghead , studied how working-class Americans, particularly women, African Americans, and immigrants, imagined themselves as organic intellectuals. He is currently completing a book about socialism in American cultural history as part of the American Studies Now series at University of California Press. Lecklider also brings to the department an interest in contemporary art: in February 2013 he curated an exhibit, Lifelines: Recent Work by Avram Finkelstein , that featured contemporary paintings and sculpture by an important founding member of Gran Fury and ACT UP.
