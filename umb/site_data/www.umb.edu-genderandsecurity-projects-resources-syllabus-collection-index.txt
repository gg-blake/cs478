The collection is intended to support the expansion and strengthening of education in this field by acting as a resource for teachers who want to design new courses or to update existing ones. Researchers, as well as readers new to the field, may also find it useful to explore these syllabi, as they represent a distillation of the readings that professors have found most useful in teaching about their areas of expertise. In the interest of finding framings of and readings about these issues from multiple perspectives, we have endeavored to collect syllabi from as many countries as possible, although there is significant regional variation in whether or how syllabi are constructed and available.
