Annual Security Report The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (20 USC § 1092(f)) is a landmark federal law, originally known as the Campus Security Act, that requires colleges and universities across the United States to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. Because the law is tied to participation in federal student financial aid programs it applies to most public and private institutions of higher education. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Education. The law was amended in 1992 to add a requirement that schools afford victims of campus sexual assault certain basic rights, and was amended again in 1998 to expand the reporting requirements. The 1998 amendments also formally named the law in memory of Jeanne Clery. Subsequent amendments in 2000, 2008 and 2013 added provisions dealing with registered sex offender notification, campus emergency response, and the Violence Against Women Act. 2024 UMass Boston Annual Security and Fire Safety Report UMass Boston Police Quinn Administration Building, 1st Floor, Room 100 Emergency: 911 Cell Phone Emergency: 617.287.7777 General Information: 617.287.7799 Police Dispatch: 617.287.7780, 617.287.7781 Police Tip Line: 617.287.5555 617.287.7785 Public Safety & Police Emergency: DIAL 911 General Information &  Dispatch: (617) 287-7777 Tip Line: (617) 287-5555 UMass Boston Police Quinn Administration Building, 1st Floor, Room 100 Directions Confidential Witness Comments & Suggestions Citizen Complaints Parking Ticke ts Lost & Found Weather Related Matters For information on weather-related closings call 617.287.5000 or tune your radio to WBZ 1030 AM, WRKO 680 AM, WBUR 90.9 FM, or WUMB 91.9 FM, or tune your television to WBZ-TV CH 4, WCVB-TV Ch 5, or WHDH-TV Ch 7 for up-to-the-minute information on university cancellations.
