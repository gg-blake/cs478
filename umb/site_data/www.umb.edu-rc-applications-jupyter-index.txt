Tunnel the port using your local machine, and use the node name noted above ssh john.doe001@gibbs.umb.edu  -L  8002:localhost:8001 ssh gibbs18  -L 8001:localhost:8888 Final port (8888) should match with jupyter port, the two middle ports should match with each other and first port (8002) will be the local machine port, which will be used on browser using http://localhost:8002/ Note: Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
