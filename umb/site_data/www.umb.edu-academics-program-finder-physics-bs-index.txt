Start your journey toward a professional or academic career in physical science. Learn the fundamental principals of mechanics, fluids, waves, and kinetic theory. Move on to explore thermodynamics, electricity, and magnetism in mathematical terms. Consider whether a career in physics is for you. To obtain a BS in physics you must earn a minimum of 40 credits in physics courses including the following: Physics 113: Fundamentals of Physics I and Physics 181: Physics Laboratory I Physics 114: Fundamentals of Physics II and Physics 182: Physics Laboratory II Physics 211: Introduction to Contemporary Physics and Physics 281: Physical Laboratory Physics 214: Thermodynamics Physics 312: Mechanics Physics 321: Electricity and Magnetism I Physics 322: Electricity and Magnetism II Physics 382: Intermediate Laboratory Physics 421: Atomic Physics and Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and two physics electives at the level of 300 or higher. In addition majors must complete the following science classes: CHEM 115: Chemical Principles Lecture I and CHEM 117: Chemical Principles Laboratory I CHEM 116: Chemical Principles Lecture II  and CHEM 117: Chemical Principles Laboratory II MATH 240: Multivariable Calculus (or preferably MATH 242: Multivariable and Vector Calculus) MATH 270: Applied Ordinary Differential Equations Introduction to Computing or an approved substitute. (Students with proficiency in computer programming may request from the department a waiver of the CS 110 requirement.) Students should note that the university requires for a BS degree six mathematics or science courses outside of the student's major field. Most physics majors (especially those planning graduate work and/or professional careers in physical science) will want to take more physics and mathematics courses than the minimum required for graduation. Students planning to pursue graduate studies are recommended to take Electricity and Magnetism II and Statistical Physics and two or more semesters of mathematics courses such as Linear Algebra and Introduction to Complex Analysis. All majors are encouraged to gain a facility with one or more computer programming languages.
