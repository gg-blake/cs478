Teach Next Year (TNY) is a one-year, full-time master’s program to prepare educators to teach in urban and high need schools. The TNY teacher residency program seeks committed individuals interested in making a positive impact on students’ success in our partnering schools. It is an intensive, site-based educational experience and provides the support of professors, practitioners, and colleagues while it supplies the challenge of study practice and exploration. Through working with dedicated faculty to develop your teaching skills, action research skills, and knowledge of child development, our graduates are prepared to work in urban, diverse, and inclusive settings and serve children and their families as soon as they graduate. How TNY Works Students start their course work during the summer and complete 4 courses over two summer sections. Students are then placed in schools to work full time as interns throughout the school, culminating in their student teaching experience in the spring. In the meantime, students complete the remaining 8 courses during the Fall and Spring semesters in the afternoon or evening. In addition to a master’s degree and teacher licensure, the TNY program also prepares graduate students for add-on licensure in Special Education - Moderate Disabilities (SPED) and/or English as a Second Language (ESL). Program Options Students can select from the following license areas when participating in TNY. For more information on the programs and curriculum for the specific program areas, please see the pages for that license and master’s degree.
