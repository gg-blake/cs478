For nearly 40 years, UMass Boston’s nationally-recognized Asian American Studies Program has addressed the social, cultural, and educational needs of students while supporting the critical capacity-building needs of local Asian American communities. Through a flexible, six-course program of study (comparable to a minor) or a 10-course individually designed major, you'll work closely with award-winning faculty and an empowering, multidisciplinary curriculum while developing critical skills in research, reflection, storytelling, community-building, and leadership. Students who complete this program often pursue graduate school pathways and careers in education, social work, community development, media production, business entrepreneurship, public health, and other fields affected by the demographic growth of the Asian American population and the continuing challenges of anti-Asian hate. UMass Boston offers the most Asian American Studies courses and resources of any university in New England and is federally-designated as an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI).
