(DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.02.103) Additional Information Lab Location: ISC-3620 The Foster group does surface chemistry and experimental physical chemistry. We use optical spectroscopies, such as diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and scanning probe microscopies, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), and combination techniques, such as a Raman microscope spectrometer, to study chemical reactions and processes happening at complex interfaces. The group has four areas of focus. Green chemistry, including: (a) adsorption studies on metal oxide nanoparticles to help explain heterogeneous catalytic processes, and (b) mechanistic studies on solid acid catalysts Materials science, including: (a) nanomechanical properties of novel core-shell nano/micro-spherical particles, and (b) physical properties of novel liquid-metal systems Alternative energy processes, including: (a) adsorption processes in dye-sensitized solar cells, and (b) modification and optimization of activated carbon Biological chemistry, including: (a) investigation of the morphology of amyloid fibrils, and (b) visualization of other biological macromolecules UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
