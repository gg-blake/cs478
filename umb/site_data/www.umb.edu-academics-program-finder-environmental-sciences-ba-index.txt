Gain the background and skills to succeed as an environmental policymaker or management professional. Preparing environmental policy and management professionals, our nationally recognized BA in Environmental Science program integrates policy, management, and law with the natural sciences. Students gain practical experiences at the intersection of science and policy through coursework and real-world problem solving in our senior capstone course, internships, research, and cooperative education programs. Majors may focus their studies on policy and management (Policy and Management Track), policy-earth systems (Earth and Hydrologic Science Track), and policy-marine systems (Marine Science Track). Students interested in a career in the sciences or pursuing a graduate degree in the sciences should pursue a BS in environmental science. What the School Offers to Ensure Your Success Our Academic Achievement Services Center (AASC@SFE) offers a breadth of programs and activities designed to support you in your journey. Whether you seek additional support for your classes, want to explore internships or research, or merely want to more deeply engage with our alumni or fellow students, AASC@SFE is always here for you.  AASC@SFE offers support and connections for advising, student support (academic, financial, health), career services and opportunities, access to Living-Learning Community programs, and Student Clubs and Organizations. What You Can Take The BA in environmental science provides students the opportunity to focus their studies, through degree tracks, in marine science, policy & management, and earth & hydrologic science. Students may also pursue a general track allowing them to take a breath of courses across the environmental disciplines. Current students in all track programs should refer to the undergraduate catalog for program requirements.
