The new building has begun to advance student and faculty access, engagement, and success with state-of-the art research, teaching, and training laboratories. Its design promotes collaboration among students, faculty, staff, and visitors while opening doors to strategic and community partnerships and funding opportunities. Adjacent to the Quinn Administration Building and the Healey Library, the ISC has made an immediate welcoming impact upon those entering the campus from Morrissey Boulevard and to pedestrians approaching the building. The building was designed by Boston-based architectural firm, Goody Clancy, and built by Walsh Brothers. The project was managed by the State's Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM). The new building provides 220,000 gross square feet of space featuring: Research lab and support space (for biology, chemistry, environmental sciences, physics, and psychology) Undergraduate introductory biology teaching laboratories Interdisciplinary undergraduate sandbox teaching lab Infant cognition lab A new research center—the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy The $182 million dollar project was funded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the UMass Building Authority, and Mass Development.
