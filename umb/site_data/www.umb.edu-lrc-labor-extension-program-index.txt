While our educational sessions are as diverse as the participants we attract, one simple principle unites everything we do: linking education with action to build a stronger labor movement. Recent training sessions have dealt with such topics as workplace rights, organizing, computer skills, and corporate research, as well as skills trainings for union stewards. For information on Labor Extension-related activities on all four UMass campuses, visit the Statewide Labor Extension page.
