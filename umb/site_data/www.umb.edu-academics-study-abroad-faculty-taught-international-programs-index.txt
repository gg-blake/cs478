These UMass Boston courses are taught by UMass Boston faculty in locations around the world. Our small group, faculty-taught study abroad programs will expose you to an array of diverse peoples, cultures and settings. The programs are custom-designed and taught by experienced UMass Boston faculty. They satisfy distribution requirements and offer credit in a variety of academic disciplines, from languages and cultures, the arts and archaeology, to education, public policy, the sciences and business. There is no transfer of credit necessary. Most but not all programs are short-term in duration, affordably priced, and typically take place in summer and winter semesters. Please note that tuition waivers cannot be applied toward any study abroad program fees. Secure funding for your participation in a faculty-taught program: Look into the Beacon Student Success Fellowship, the Gilman Scholarship, and others on the scholarships page . Also check with your program faculty-leader for any current scholarship opportunities. Financial aid recipients should contact Nicole.Brennan@umb.edu to check if they can receive financial aid for their faculty-led program. Students can appeal to increase their Cost of Attendance for financial aid with a Special Circumstances Appeal Form, located on the Financial Aid Form page of umb.edu.
