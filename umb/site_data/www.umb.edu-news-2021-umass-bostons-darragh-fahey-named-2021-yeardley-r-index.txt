    UMass Boston Athletics UMass Boston lacrosse junior attackman Darragh Fahey has been selected as one of five finalists for the 2021 Yeardley Reynolds Love Unsung Hero Award, the One Love Foundation announced last week. Fahey is the first player in program history to be named a finalist. Darragh Fahey “ He is as impactful on the field as he is in the community, and has been an invaluable member of our program. ” One Love's goal is to educate, empower and activate young people in a movement to end relationship violence. The Yeardley Reynolds Love ("YRL") Unsung Hero Award recognizes the accomplishments of two student-athletes (one male, one female) who demonstrate dedication, integrity, humility, hard work, community service, leadership, kindness and sportsmanship - all qualities Yeardley Love exemplified throughout her life. These student-athletes make a significant contribution to the team in ways that may not be measured in goals, saves, or ground balls. "Darragh is a young man of great character and integrity," said head coach Tyler Low.  "He is as impactful on the field as he is in the community, and has been an invaluable member of our program." A true leader both on and off the field, Fahey has proven himself to be a dedicated member of the UMass Boston community.  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Fahey has excelled in the virtual classroom, while helping his fellow Beacons navigate the uncertainty of the 2020-21 academic year. A member of the UMass Boston Student Athlete Advisory Committee, Fahey played a crucial role in helping advance the department's focus on mental health and student-athlete well-being.  He spearheaded a series of "Mental Health Conversations" with the UMass Boston team physician on a variety of topics.  A member of the Little East Conference All-Academic Teams as a sophomore and as a junior, Fahey has catapulted UMass Boston lacrosse to new heights, including winning their first LEC Regular Season title. The winners will be announced in late May.
