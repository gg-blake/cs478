As an active student, you have access to email, calendar, Microsoft Office apps (both web-based and on your computer or iPad), and OneDrive for online file storage and collaboration. Additionally, your campus user ID and password provide access to WISER, Blackboard, campus Wifi, and more. This page will guide you through getting started in just a few simple steps! Your campus user ID and email address will be sent to your personal email address if you provided it to us, or to your home via U.S. postal mail. This will also contain a link to our Account Claiming web page , which will allow you to set up your security questions and password. Be sure to create a good password - see our password security page for tips on creating a good password. Request Email Account Form Go to webmail.umb.edu and log in with your full UMass Boston email address (ending in @umb.edu) and your new password. Log in to webmail If you get the message: Something went wrong. :-( The most likely reason is that your mailbox has not been created yet. Please try again in an hour. You will still be able to use your campus user ID and password to access WISER and other services. After logging into webmail, you will be prompted to select the language and time zone for the account. The time zone for Boston is GMT–05:00 Eastern Standard Time (US and Canada). Save your choices and you will be taken to your inbox. Remember to sign out when you're done by choosing "Sign out" from the menu that appears when you click your name. (Always log out of WISER, Blackboard, etc., when you have finished, as well, to protect your privacy.) For students who become staff employees, once HR lists you as an active employee, your account will be adjusted to grant employee access rights automatically. The UMass system has a one email account policy; your student account will continue to work as a staff/faculty email. For an introduction to Office 365 webmail and its features, see Get started with Office 365 Education (support.office.com) . You can use a mail program on your computer or mobile device to check your mail, see one of these guides from Microsoft for details.
