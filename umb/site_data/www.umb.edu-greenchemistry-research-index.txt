By increasing our understanding of how enzymes perform challenging chemical transformations at the molecular level, we aim to develop systems that can be further manipulated for benefits that include biocatalysis and natural product engineering.

Jason Evans Two problems associated with the arsenal of antibiotics commonly used to treat infections are the evolutionary development of resistance and persistence in our environment, which presents risks to aquatic ecosystems, as well as, to human health. The Evans laboratory is interested in developing a strategy for discovering a new greener class of antibiotics, based on tunichromes extracted and isolated from anthropods.

Particular targets of interest are radicals that can lead to the formation of environmentally harmful byproducts such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Transient species are produced from stable fuel precursors in a discharge or thermal cracking source and isolated in a vacuum chamber to “freeze out” further chemistry. Subsequently, laser-based mass-selective and fluorescence spectroscopies are employed to interrogate the products and determine their electronic and molecular structures, which are vital inputs for validating and generating models of combustion chemistry.
