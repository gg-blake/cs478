Remarkable life history polymorphism may be evolving under divergent selection in the silverleaf sunflower. Molecular Ecology 25: 3817. doi:10.1111/mec.13723 Additional Information Research Interests The Moyers Lab studies how and why traits vary within plant species to address real world problems, including food production and species conservation. They integrate approaches from the fields of ecology, physiology, genetics, and evolutionary biology. They work in the field, the greenhouse, the lab, and on high-performing computer clusters.
