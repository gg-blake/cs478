Proper response by individuals will assure the safety of others and limit the damage caused by fire and smoke. IF SMOKE AND/OR FIRE ARE SHOWING 1. Call for help immediately by either activating one of the alarm pull stations (located in corridors) or call the campus police at 911 , whichever is closer & faster. Provide information about location (building, floor, room). Do not use a public pay phone or your cell phone. 2. Direct everyone to evacuate the building. Do not wait for other people around you to evacuate.  Take responsibility for your own safety. Exit through the nearest safe stairwell that leads directly outside. Do not use open stairs. Use closed stairwells instead. There are exit signs posted to identify the doors leading to the stairwells. Once inside the stairwell, follow the directional exit arrows and leave the stairwell through the doors marked "EXIT." 3. DO NOT USE THE ELEVATORS. 4. If you see any mobility impaired individuals seeking refuge by moving into protected stairwells, call 911 and report the location of the individuals. 5. DO NOT USE A PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER UNLESS: You know the fire department is being called You know the building is being evacuated You are trained in the extinguisher's use and feel confident about using it The proper type extinguisher is available The fire is small and contained The exit is clear and you can fight the fire with your back to the exit You can stay low and avoid breathing smoke IF SMOKY ODORS ARE DETECTED BUT NOT SEEN Call campus police right away at 911 from a campus phone and describe the situation. Provide the location (building, floor, room). Notify your supervisor of the situation and what you have done. Monitor the area until campus police arrive.
