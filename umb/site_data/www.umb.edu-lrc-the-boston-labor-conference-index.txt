Stay tuned for the Call for Proposals announcement in Fall 2024! Boston Labor Conference 2024 Boston Labor Conference 2024 Labor and the State Today Questions of whether and how organized workers should engage the state are as old as the labor movement. Still, the pitfalls and possibilities of this engagement have been particularly stark in 2023. Amid a generational upsurge in militant labor action, a sitting president joined a picket line for the first time, just months after the Supreme Court reaffirmed its willingness to dismantle settled labor law on behalf of its billionaire benefactors. The most labor-friendly NLRB in decades has supported a wave of new union elections while Amazon and Starbucks brazenly flout the Board’s limited power to punish union busting. Labor-led coalitions have elected progressive city councilors and mayors promising reinvestment in the public good, even as the far right works to strip elected representatives of power and entrench minority rule through state-level gerrymandering and judicial chicanery. As the 2024 presidential election looms, the fraught relationship between labor and government is as crucial as ever.
