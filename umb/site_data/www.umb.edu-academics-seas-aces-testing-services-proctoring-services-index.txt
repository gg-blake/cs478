To set up a proctored test, email uac.testing@umb.edu with a request for dates and times that would work for you. The Testing Center staff will then reach out to your professor to request the exam materials and specific instructions as it relates to; time allotted, materials allowed, and exam-return instructions. Students will then be notified of all Testing Center proctoring policies as listed here . UMass Boston students taking online courses may request in-person proctoring by following the instructions above (same as make-up exam procedures).  UMass Boston students taking online courses who are unable to come for in-person proctoring, (i.e.., if they reside out of state), are encouraged to arrange external proctoring services at a testing site close to their location. Normally, such testing requests require a fee decided upon by the external testing site.  Those students often find it helpful to search for a college or university close-by and inquire with their testing center, or to search for one via the National College Testing Association (NCTA) database of certified testing centers. Students will need to work closely withh their instructor to ensure that the exam materials, testing instructions, and exam-return instructions are communicated to the external testng center. All students are required to produce photo identification upon testing.  The following are acceptable forms of ID:  Driver’s license, State/Federal ID, Passport, or Student ID. Our Testing Center is ADA compliant. Students requiring ADA accommodations must make arrangements with the Testing Center well in advance of their scheduled test date.
