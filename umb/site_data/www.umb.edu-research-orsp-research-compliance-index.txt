The university’s goal is to provide information, support, and administrative systems necessary to ensure compliance with regulations and policies governing research in the most efficient and effective manner possible. The compliance program is designed to be proactive, transparent, and integrated to such an extent that potential issues are identified and mitigated without compromising the conduct of research. Research Compliance contributes to a culture of research excellence at UMass Boston by ensuring compliance with federal, state, and local regulations related to research activities, creating and supporting an environment that promotes the ethical and responsible conduct of research, and developing training and educational resources that promote responsible conduct and integrity in research. Because the University takes this obligation seriously, we have continued to provide various mechanisms within the University to assist and encourage employees and students to come forward in good faith with reports or concerns about suspected research compliance issues, without fear of reprisal or retaliation. This hotline accepts reports via the internet and assures anonymity during the report intake process when requested.
