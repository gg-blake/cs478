Slurm Chimera is using the Slurm scheduler. There is significant documentation available for slurm commands via the man pages. Try 'man sbatch' for submission related commands and 'man squeue' for status queries. Partitions Partitions and billing weights are shown below. The 'sinfo' command will show current partition status. The billing weights show the relative 'cost' (as manifest in the impact use has on fairshare priority) of CPU, memory, or GPU for each node.

Slurm will not schedule an individual job or task on multiple partitions. This partition is only recommended for MPI jobs where you are ok spanning multiple node types. If you want your job to run on any Intel node, but not span multiple nodes with different CPUs, specify a comma separated list of partitions to be considered.
