Utilizing high-fidelity simulators and sophisticated medical equipment creates realistic medical environments and allows students to transfer their learning from the classroom to the clinical setting.  Specific learning objectives are related to patient-centered care, safety, communication and teamwork. Simulation provides valuable insight to the ability to think critically during a high-stakes, low-frequency event. In addition, cultural and ethical dilemmas are embedded into simulation exercises, allowing students to evaluate and reflect on their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes.
