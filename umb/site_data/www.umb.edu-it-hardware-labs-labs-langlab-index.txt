Additional Resources Language Placement Test (WebCape) In order for students to enjoy the best educational experience, faculty will recommend that students take a placement test prior to registering for a  course. The Latin American and Iberian Studies Department uses a computerized placement exam called WebCape to help place students in the appropriate language level for Spanish. The test is administered at the testing center and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. It gives each student his/her score and level immediately following completion of the test. Spanish Language Placement Test Language Lab Textbooks and Workbooks A limited number of textbooks and workbooks used for language courses are available on loan from the Healey Library Circulation Desk. Faculty must arrange to place books on Healey Library Reserve for a loan to students.
