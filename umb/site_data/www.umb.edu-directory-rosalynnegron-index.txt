I am also an Affiliate Faculty at the Gastón Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy, and the Critical Ethnic & Community Studies graduate program, and a member of the Core Team for UMass Boston's Sustainable Solutions Lab , a research institute dedicated to understanding the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations and working with them to develop sustainable and equitable solutions. I received my PhD in Anthropology from the University of Florida in 2007. My work engages with two main themes: 1) Part of my work is bound together by an overarching interest in the role of complex social environments on the decisions that people make for their social, economic, and physical well-being : migration and health decisions, identity negotiations, linguistic and educational choices. 2) Another part of my work is to understand ways to build relationships and bridges that make collective action possible, especially in ways that connect frontline communities to expanded forms of power. I'm interested in interaction , connection , cooperation , and knowledge integration across differences. With a range of applications, my work bridges multiple substantive and disciplinary areas, including social network analysis, sociolinguistics, health disparities, and disparities in STEM participation. I have done research in Jamaica, Florida, New York City, Puerto Rico, and Boston. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, the Ford Foundation, and the Max Planck Institute for Religious and Ethnic Diversity. I teach several research design and methods courses at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, with specialties in ethnographic methods, problem-centered transdisciplinary, and mixed methods research.
