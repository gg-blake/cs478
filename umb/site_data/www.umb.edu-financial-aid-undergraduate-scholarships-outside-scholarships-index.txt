We encourage you to keep the following things in mind when searching for scholarships: Never pay a fee to be considered for a scholarship, or to access a scholarship search website. Think local! Many scholarship opportunities come through your high school, clubs, the place of your parent or guardians’ employment, or a community group. Competition for local scholarships tends to be less competitive as they typically receive fewer applications. Beware of scams or predatory websites, your personal information is a valuable resource. If something sounds too good to be true or you are being asked for more information than you are comfortable giving, don’t apply. Outside scholarships have not been vetted or endorsed by UMass Boston If you are the recipient of an outside scholarship: If you are the recipient of an outside scholarship please contact the Financial Aid Office to determine how it may impact your aid.
