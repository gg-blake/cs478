Electro-chemistry will include an overview of the theories of ionics, electrodiscs, and charge transfer. These theories will then be applied to the understanding of a variety of electroanalytical techniques and electrochemical applications such as contemporary batteries and fuel cells. Electroanalytical techniques to be discussed include static and dynamic methods for application of controlled voltage (potentiometric) and controlled current (coulometric) as well as ion detection, electro-separation, and conductometric methods. Specific topics emphasized will include electrochemical instrumentation, reference electrodes, cyclic voltammetry, microelectrochemistry, and contemporary ion selective electrode analysis.
