BVS involves students in a social justice movement by participating in week-long trips both domestically and internationally and through on-campus commitments throughout the year. BVS hopes to address social issues such as: Mental Health Stigma; HIV/AIDS; Border, Refugee & Immigration; Environment; Rural Poverty; Urban Poverty; Youth & Education; Domestic Violence; Disaster Relief; Health & Aging, etc. The program at UMass Boston is a student leadership model. Student leaders are trained to coordinate the trip including developing community partnerships, fundraising, and travel. As students are selected to participate, they become active participants in the entire trip planning process. Our program follows Break Away's eight components of a quality alternative break .
