Additional Information Research Interests Research in Liam Revell's lab is concentrated in two main areas: computational method development for phylogenetics (primarily phylogenetic comparative biology); and evolutionary ecology of reptiles. He is presently conducting most of his computational method development in the R language and statistical computing environment and he developed, supports, and maintains an extensive, multifunctional R phylogenetics library, 'phytools.' Students and postdocs in his lab are presently conducting research on tropical reptiles. For instance, they are studying adaptation to urban environments in Puerto Rican Anolis lizards; and they are investigating the evolutionary diversification and conservation genetics of an imperiled clade of Caribbean boas.
