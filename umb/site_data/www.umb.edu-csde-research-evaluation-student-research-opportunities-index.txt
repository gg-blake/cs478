Unique to CSDE's mission is the value it places on the social development of children and adolescents who have learning or behavioral problems, and on fostering relationships with families and schools to ensure the development of a socially competent and well-adjusted student. As a result of the many accomplishments of its multidisciplinary staff, CSDE is recognized locally, nationally, and internationally (in 28 countries) as one of few institutes that addresses the social aspects of students in education.
