The Financial Aid Office assigns an estimated cost of attendance for each student that includes direct and indirect costs to attend UMass Boston for one academic year (Fall and Spring semesters). The COA is based on residency status, career level, dependency status, and whether the student will be living on campus, off campus, or with parents. Directs costs include charges that will appear on the student invoice, such as tuition and fees. Indirect costs do not appear on the student invoice. These are estimated allowances for other expenses that students may incur while attending the university. For example, costs for books, supplies, transportation, personal expenses, and off-campus housing. The COA will vary depending upon the number of credits a student enrolls in and, in some cases, their academic program. Detailed information about tuition and fees can be found via the Bursar’s Office . It's important to note that costs may vary from what is outlined below. These are estimates. The Bursar Office provides actual charges that a student can anticipate. In-State Undergraduate Dependent Student Full Time (12 Credits) .
