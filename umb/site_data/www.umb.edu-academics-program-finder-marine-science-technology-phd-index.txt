Become an expert able to analyze environmental questions across multiple natural and social science perspectives. Our PhD program centers around issues of biological oceanography, marine ecosystems, climate change impacts on the oceans, and marine policy and management. The oceans are part of the thin, outer shell of the Earth and marine science is the study of this envelope, from the deep sea to shallow coastal oceans. These systems are dynamic and vast, containing most of the Earth's water and carbon and surface heat, and much of its biomass. Working like a machine in concert with the atmosphere, continents and ice oceans drive our climate system and support all life on our planet. Learning Outcomes Students will be able to apply the scientific method and design appropriate experiments to answer environmental science questions. Students will understand the contributions of laboratory, field, and survey data collection and analysis for approaching environmental science problems. Students will be able to analyze and critique environmental questions across multiple natural and social science perspectives and research approaches. Students will demonstrate analytical and quantitative proficiencies to analyze environmental and/or social science data. Students will understand the system interactions and feedback between human activities and social institutions and the natural environment. Students will be experienced in communicating their learnings both in writing, visually, and orally, and for specific and general audiences.
