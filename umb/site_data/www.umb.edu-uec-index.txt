This office is a resource for university faculty, staff, and students to assist with the planning process, from the initial space request, to developing a program and designing invitations to decor and menu consultation. The hope is that all events on campus will follow similar procedures and protocol to ensure that our campus community and guests have the best experience possible when attending an event at the university. The Office of University Events and Ceremonies plans and manages all events hosted by the chancellor , including fall convocation and commencement activities, as well as the chancellor’s receptions and social events. The office works in conjunction with University Advancement to plan and execute fundraising events, and is a resource for deans, directors of institutes and centers, and administrators to review event planning procedures and assist with the planning of any upcoming events. The office also assists in coordinating events with the scheduling offices on campus – the staff of Marine Operations , Campus Center , and Athletics – to ensure the success of campus-wide events.
