The College of Liberal Arts offers students the opportunity to study a variety of fields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Fine Arts—from English to Economics, Africana Studies to Women’s Studies, Performing Arts to Psychology—as well as in interdisciplinary programs such as Asian Studies that span two or more fields of study. College of Liberal Arts alumni have gone on to become physicians, writers, TV producers, architects, teachers, elected officials, CEOs, sculptors, police officers, and more. More than 5,000 students—close to 50% of UMass Boston’s undergraduates—are currently working toward degrees in the 27 majors offered by the college’s 19 departments.
