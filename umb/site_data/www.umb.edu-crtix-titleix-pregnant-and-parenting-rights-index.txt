A pregnant student can continue to participate in all classes and co-curricular activities including clubs, sports, and student leadership opportunities. A pregnant student can ask for accommodation from the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX ("CRTIX") due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. This covers instances of such student’s pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom. Upon request, this office can assist pregnant students with such accommodations as: providing an opportunity to make up missed work wherever possible, including class participation and attendance credits; extending deadlines and requesting, make‐up assignments (e.g., papers, quizzes, tests, and presentations); making modifications to the physical environment (such as accessible seating); providing information on requesting a grade of incomplete to be completed at a later date; a voluntary leave of absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student’s physician, and then effectively reinstating the student to the same status as was held when the leave began adjustments equivalent to those provided to students with other temporary disabilities or medical conditions; allowing breastfeeding students reasonable time and space to pump breast milk in a private location and extend timed assignments to accommodate lactation The Title IX coordinator, or their designee, will engage in an interactive process to identify the accommodations that are necessary and appropriate to inform faculty members of the need to adjust academic parameters accordingly. If a proposed accommodation would fundamentally alter a course, program, or service the Title IX coordinator, or their designee, will work with the student, faculty member and/or department on a case by case basis to offer alternative accommodations. Information about pregnant students’s requests for accommodations will be shared with faculty and staff only to the extent necessary to provide the reasonable accommodation. Faculty and staff will regard all information associated with such requests as private and will not disclose this information unless necessary. Students and faculty are encouraged to work together to implement agreed upon accommodations, including anticipating the need for leaves, minimizing the impact of absences, and getting back on track as efficiently and comfortably as possible. The Title IX coordinator, or their designee, will assist with plan development and implementation as needed. No time limitations will be imposed on requests for accommodations, but students are encouraged to proactively request accommodations. To get more information or to request possible accommodations contact CivilRights.TitleIX@umb.edu . You do not need to register with the Ross Center for Disability Services to receive pregnancy accommodations. For access to private lactation spaces on campus contact CivilRights.TitleIX@umb.edu to obtain the location and access code. Faculty and staff are encouraged to contact CRTIX regarding potential pregnancy accommodations for students to ensure equal access to programs and services. UMB maintains a policy of non-discrimination in its educational programs and activities based on the student’s current, potential, or past pregnancy or related condition.
