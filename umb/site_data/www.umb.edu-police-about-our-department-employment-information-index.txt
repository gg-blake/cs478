Police Cadets Police Cadets are paid, non-sworn, student employees who have an interest in law enforcement or who want to pursue a career in law enforcement. The program allows students to get invaluable hands-on experience in law enforcement while still pursuing their educational goals. Complementing the UMBPD, the Police Cadets provide an additional level of security and further strengthen the UMBPD community policing efforts. Assigned primarily in the residential areas, the cadets work very closely with police officers and members of the Residence Halls.  As students, they often see and hear what the police cannot, spotting problems early and alerting police to intervene and prevent escalation. Police Cadets are paid $15.00 per hour.  Cadets have a flexible schedule and are required to work a maximum of 15 hours a week. A cadet’s participation in the program can be used toward credit hours or for the work study program. You must complete an application to be considered for selection, to request more information please contact Lt. Kris Kamborian ( kris.kamborian@umass.edu ).
