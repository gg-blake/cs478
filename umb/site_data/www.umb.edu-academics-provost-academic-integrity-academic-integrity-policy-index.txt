The goal of our Student Code of Conduct is to set clear expectations for behavior and ensure a safe and respectful environment for all members of the UMass Boston community. Within the Student Code of Conduct is a section on academic honesty and integrity. This section is called Appendix B: Academic Honesty and it outlines UMass Boston's requirements for upholding academic integrity. Review Appendix B in full Summary of Appendix B Every part of academic life, including classes and all educational interactions, must be carried out with complete honesty. Any work submitted by a student is assumed to be their own and expected to follow University policies on academic honesty. If an error in academic integrity is found—even after a course or degree completion—actions can be taken, up to revoking the degree. Students are encouraged to report any suspected academic dishonesty to their instructor. For a full list of actions that constitute academic dishonesty, refer to Types of Academic Integrity Issues . Faculty members can discuss potential academic integrity issues with the student or their department heads before formally reporting the issue. If the faculty member proceeds with formal charges, they must inform the student in writing within ten business days. This communication should explain the charges, proposed sanctions, and a meeting date to discuss the case. If, after further review, the faculty member believes no dishonesty occurred, they will drop the charges and inform all parties involved. The process also includes a review by higher university officials, who may impose additional sanctions, especially for serious or repeated offenses. The student has the right to appeal these decisions to an appeal panel (convened by the Provost), which will review the case and make a final recommendation. The Provost’s decision is final, except for expulsion appeals, which can be made to the Chancellor. Examples of academic dishonesty sanctions include a failing grade for an assignment or even the course. In severe cases, faculty may recommend further penalties, which are considered university sanctions, as outlined in the Student Code of Conduct.
