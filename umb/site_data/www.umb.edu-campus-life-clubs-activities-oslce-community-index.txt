There are many ways that the University and neighboring organizations have been working together through community engagement. The Office of Student Leadership and Community Engagement helps facilitate community engagement, recruit student volunteers and inform students of volunteer opportunities available at community organizations. How can you initiate a collaboration or project with the Office of Student Leadership and Community Engagement? Our office encourages organizations and individuals to inform us of community engagement opportunities for our students. If you are interested in developing a university-wide partnership, go to the Office of Community Partnerships site. If you are interested in participating in a fall or spring volunteer fair, please email community.engagement@umb.edu .
