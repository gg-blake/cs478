I eventually headed east and received my BA in history at Oberlin College, and then my PhD in history at the University of Pennsylvania. Area of Expertise Professor Hacsi's research interests focus on the history of American public policy in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially policy pertaining to children and families, the history of education, and the history of poverty and public responses to poverty. Degrees PhD (History) University of Pennsylvania BA (History) Oberlin College Professional Publications & Contributions Second Home: Orphan Asylums and Poor Families in America (Harvard University Press, 1998). Children as Pawns: the Politics of Educational Reform (Harvard University Press, 2002). “Innovation and Accountability: Vouchers, Charters, and the Florida Virtual School.” In Reform Florida , edited by Alex Molnar, Education Policy Studies Laboratory, Arizona State University, April 2004.

Additional Information Following graduate school, I held a postdoctoral fellowship in children’s policy at the University of Chicago and then a Spencer postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University, after which I returned to my roots as a historian and came to the University of Massachusetts Boston. My current research is on higher education in the 20th century, particularly the ways in which various groups (people of color and women) have sought to receive equal treatment within public universities after gaining initial entrance.
