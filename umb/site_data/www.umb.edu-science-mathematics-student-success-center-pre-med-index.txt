Competition to all of these programs remains at a high level. Planning ahead has obvious advantages, since students are expected to apply one year or more before the time they hope to begin classes in these medical/health care programs. Admission tests are mandatory and should be taken as early as possible. The tests are generally based on material covered in premedical courses, so when the courses are completed and sufficient time has been budgeted for test preparation, that determines when the test should be taken.
