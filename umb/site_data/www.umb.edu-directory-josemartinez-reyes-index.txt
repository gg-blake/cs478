He is also engaged in a study about Mayan perceptions of climate change and how their traditional ecological knowledge adapts to address such changes particularly in their agricultural practices. His research in general focuses the ways that people engage, perceive, and create meanings and knowledge about the environment and how that engagement is influenced by wider networks of power relations.  Based on extensive field research in Quintana Roo, Mexico, he has studied the conflicts over the privatization and management of forest resources on a Biosphere Reserve between the Maasewal Maya, local NGOs, and the state. A book detailing this research titled “ Moral Ecology of a Forest: Nature Industry and Maya Post-Conservation ” was published by University of Arizona Press in November 2016.
