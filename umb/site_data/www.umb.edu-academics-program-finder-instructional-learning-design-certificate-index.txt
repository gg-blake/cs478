This graduate certificate focuses specifically on design, assessment, and evaluation considerations of instruction. As well, this certificate addresses learning theory and other design elements required in training and education. The content of this certificate is applied across all education and training arenas that involve adult learners, including higher education institutes, corporate associations, and health care industries.
