Applying single-discipline approaches cannot adequately solve modern theoretical and empirical problems in the areas of Biomedical Engineering, Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Computational Physics, Biochemistry, and Data Analysis. Moreover, interdisciplinary training is increasingly sought by both the academia and the industry. Our programs will train researchers that are prepared to tackle these problems who, after graduation, can continue their training as postdoctoral researchers or advance their careers as biotech and computational sciences professionals. The participating faculty who are leading the interdisciplinary research on campus are associated with the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and School for the Environment. Over the past two decades, they have been actively engaged in research collaboration projects within the College of Science and Mathematics and across the campus. Our faculty also have NIH-funded collaborations with major teaching hospitals such as Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital.
