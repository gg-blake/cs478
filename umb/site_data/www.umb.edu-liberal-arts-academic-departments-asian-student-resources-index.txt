Talk with your advisor about your career plans, so that he or she can help you choose courses that support your career interests after graduation. Office of Career Services The Office of Career Services is designed to help you explore career possibilities, investigate employment trends, and consider graduate school options. Their staff can provide individual advising and workshops on job search strategies, resume writing, and interviewing. Their online career database, Handshake , provides UMass Boston students and alumni access to job postings, career event details, on-campus recruitment activities, and the bi-weekly Job Bulletin. In addition, the Career Resource Library offers many helpful publications related to careers and graduate study. This library is open Monday thru Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and can be used on a walk-in basis. Professional Organizations Many academic associations and professional organizations offer online career resources which may be of interest to students and emerging professionals. Searches of the groups' websites may reveal professional development advice, open job postings, and conference information. Professional organizations related to our department’s majors include (but are not limited to): The Association for Asian Studies The Association for Asian Studies (AAS) is a scholarly, non-political, nonprofit professional association open to all persons interested in Asia and the study of Asia. With approximately 8,000 members worldwide, representing all the regions and countries of Asia and all academic disciplines, the AAS is the largest organization of its kind. The American Institute of Indian Studies The American Institute of Indian Studies (AIIS) was formed to further the knowledge of India in the United States by supporting American scholarship on India. The programs of AIIS promote and advance mutual understanding between the citizens of the U. S. and of India. More than 6,000 scholars and creative artists have received AIIS support, with their work spanning the humanities, social sciences, social policy and natural sciences. The American Institute of Bangladesh Studies American Institute of Bangladesh Studies (AIBS) is an association of institutions of higher learning in the United States aimed at promoting scholarly understanding between Bangladesh and the United States. Incorporated in 1988, AIBS provides senior and junior fellowships as well as pre-dissertation grants for U.S. scholars and students to visit Bangladesh and observe first-hand the problems facing a developing country. Beyond the Classroom There are many options and opportunities for you to study overseas! There are also opportunities for funding, including the full use of your FAFSA Pell grant, to cover living expenses while overseas. These opportunities depend a great deal on the circumstances of individual students. Interested students should contact the Study Abroad Office in the Office of Global Programs to explore funding opportunities and university partners (https://www.umb.edu/academics/global/studyabroad/programs/exchange ). Part of the study abroad process and before a student studies abroad, you will need to visit the financial aid office at UMass Boston, part of whose job it is to make sure each student has sufficient funds to support them. Students should also try to find information about what courses are available at these institutions, choose some particular courses, and if possible reach a prior written agreement with appropriate faculty at UMass Boston as to what kind of credit will be transferred to UMass Boston on their return. This is accomplished by completing the "Request For Prior Approval of Transfer Credit of Study Abroad Programs" form which is obtained in the Office of Global Programs.
