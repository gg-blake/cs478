YOU CANNOT REGISTER FOR THIS EVENT. Boston Harbor is Indigenous space. Indigenous Boston Harbor is a free boat tour of Boston Harbor and the Harbor Islands and a walking tour of Deer Island. Indigenous Boston Harbor is led by Elizabeth Solomon, Faries Gray, and Craig Podgurski, members of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag, and organized by artists Nicholas Brown and Sarah Kanouse. Registration is required to attend . Email us at UHGallery@umb.edu for instructions. Departing from the Fox Point Pavilion and Boat Dock in a vessel from the Division of Marine Operations at UMass Boston, the boat tour focuses on Indigenous relationships—past, present, and future—with the Harbor and Harbor Islands, particularly Deer, Thompson, Peddocks, Long, and Moon Islands. Evoking a not-so-distant past when the islands were hills and the harbor was land, the boat tour navigates a dynamic land and waterscape, highlighting Indigenous climate action, and envisioning an abundant Indigenous future.
