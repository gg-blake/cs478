We hope your lives after graduating from UMass Boston have been interesting and fulfilling. We also hope your time with us in the Anthropology Department helped you to develop skills, perspectives, or knowledge that have brought you success in your job, home, personal life, and community. We would be thrilled to hear from you and to know how you are faring. Please drop us a line at anthropology@umb.edu with some updates, including your current contact information, or reach out to a past professor to keep up your connections. Soon, we will use the “Alumni” space on our website to showcase some of our graduates, both recent and not-so-recent. We want our current students (and faculty!) to hear from and about you. You may have graduated, but you are not forgotten. Please be sure to check our Department Facebook page for occasional updates about us, or keep an eye on our “UMB Archaeology” Instagram or M.A. Program Facebook page to track what our archaeologists and graduate program are doing. The Anthropology Alumnx Series Conducted as a series of interviews in 2021, this web series is a chance for our alumnx to share their stories with current and future UMass Boston Anthropology students. These eight alumnx share their experiences of what it was like for them when they were Anthropology students at UMass Boston, offer advice for current and prospective students, discuss their careers, and articulate how anthropology has shaped their lives as scholars, professionals, community members, and people.
