The goal of Mohamed Gharbi's research is to develop new mechanisms of directed assembly and combine these tools with functional nanomaterials to generate multi-functional hybrid systems with unique properties. By exploiting these fundamental insights, and using colloidal buildings blocks of various levels of complexity, he explores the possibility of creating a variety of reconfigurable structures with rich properties. The study of these systems will offer important insights for the design of novel "smart" applications, including biochemical sensors, self-assembled microrobots, displays, microlens arrays, photonic nanomaterials and optoelectronic devices.
