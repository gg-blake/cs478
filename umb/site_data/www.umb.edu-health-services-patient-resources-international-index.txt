As an international student, understanding the U.S. healthcare system and navigating your health insurance is crucial. Here's what you need to know: Insurance Healthcare in the U.S. can be very costly, as it relies on private health insurance rather than government-provided coverage. UMass Boston requires all international students to purchase the school's health insurance plan to avoid significant healthcare expenses. Waiving University Health Insurance You may waive the University Student Health Insurance Plan if you have comparable coverage through an alternate U.S.-issued insurance plan. This determination is made by the Bursar's Office. Family members can also be enrolled in the school insurance at an additional cost. University health plans With UMass Boston's health insurance, you can seek care at University Health Services (UHS) or any healthcare facility within or outside Massachusetts. Always keep your insurance card with you. General Medicine 24/7 Phone Line : (617) 287-5660. This is a 24-hour phone line. If UHS is closed, an on-call nurse can advise you whether you need emergency care or can wait until UHS reopens.
