Digital asset management is via Shared Shelf (a subscription service, annual fixed fee plus space charge) with distribution via Artstor to either closed community (UMass Boston only), open web (via sscommons.org), or with porting to an Omeka website. Tighter control of images can be achieved with Shared Shelf which is suitable for pre-publication images that need to be closely held. We also publish images of the Art Department student's creative work from time to time, which you can peruse in our simple Omeka site, UMass Boston Student Artwork. The VRC is part of the Art & Art History Department and is housed in University Hall, 4th Floor, Room 4257. We have a beautiful space-- come visit us or, if you'd like more information, contact the Art & Art History Department Visual Resources Manager, Louise Putnam . This website is under design, and will be expanded in the future.
