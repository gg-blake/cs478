Many of our writers work on memoirs, but others write fiction or poetry. We meet on Zoom every Wednesday, year round, from 1:00 to 3:00. Members write on any topic they choose. We try to find time for each member to read aloud, and for the group to critique, offer comments and suggestions. Some of our SIG writers have published books: Rosalind Cuschera - Journey from San Rocco Kim Lan Tran- Traveling in a Dream & Other Stories Kate Griffin Flaherty- More Alike Than Different: A Peace Corps Memoir of Malaysian Borneo, 1967-1969 Other have had submissions accepted by UMass Boston's literary journal, The Watermark , and by various online magazines.
