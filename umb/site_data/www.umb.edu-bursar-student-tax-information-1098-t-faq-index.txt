Additional FAQ What is a 1098-T and what does it report? The 1098-T is a Tuition Payment Statement that includes information that colleges and universities are required to issue to determine a student’s eligibility for education tax credits.  This form reports the amount paid by you to the University over the course of the previous calendar year and will assist you or your parents when preparing your federal income tax return. Start of tax year 2018, IRS has mandated that all education institutions must report Box 1 (amounts paid). In previous years, Box 2 (tuition billed) was reported to the IRS. - back to top When will the 1098-T form be available? The 1098-T form is mailed to your address listed in WISER by January 31st of each year. Please verify that your mailing address is updated in the WISER system. You can update your address online through WISER. The form is also available online through WISER/ Finance Center/ 1098T. -back to top What if my social security number is incorrect? By Federal law, the correct Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) should be in the WISER system for the university to distribute the 1098-T form to you correctly. Please use the UMB Student TIN Request Form via ‘DocuSign’ to submit a request to change or correct your SSN. Please use your UMB email account (e.g. John.Smith001@umb.edu) and password to file electronically. The form can be found here . -back to top What semesters are included in my 1098-T? All transactions on the 1098T reflect activity that occurred within a calendar year regardless of the term/semesters that the transaction affected. -back to top My address listed on the 1098T has changed. Will this affect me when I file my tax return? No.  The address shown on Form 1098-T is irrelevant for IRS income tax filing purposes.  However, you should update your address in WISER so that the University has up-to-date information. -back to top I am a foreign student. Do I have to file taxes? The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not require UMass Boston to file a Form 1098-T for foreign students who are not US residents for tax purposes. This is because non-resident students are not eligible for education tax benefits. However, UMass Boston cannot definitively determine which foreign students are residents for tax purposes. Also, the IRS does require UMass Boston to provide a 1098-T to a non-resident student who requests one. For these reasons we provide 1098-T forms to all students, including foreign students who may or may not be eligible for an education tax benefit. -back to top I misplaced my copy of the Form 1098-T. How do I get a reprint of my 1098-T form? The electronic version of your 1098T can be viewed and printed from your WISER account on the Finance Center page under "Tax Info". If you need further assistance you can contact our office. -back to top Why don’t the numbers on Form 1098-T equal the amounts I paid to UMass during the year? The figure for Box 1 will only include amounts paid for qualified tuition and related expenses (QTRE).  Non-qualifying expenses include but are not limited to health insurance, room and board. Please review IRS publication 970 for further information on “qualified” education expenses. -back to top I don’t understand what I’m supposed to do with this Form 1098-T? We are unable to provide tax advice. For guidance you may want to consider IRS Publication 970 in addition to choosing a Tax Professional . -back to top For additional FAQ please click on the following link: https://www.umassp.edu/treasurer/tax-and-compliance/student-tax-information -back to top Bursar's Office Campus Center, 4th Floor UMass Boston 100 Morrissey Boulevard Boston, MA 02125 Student Inquiries Phone: 617.287.5350 Hours: Monday – Thursday: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Friday: 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Email: Bursar@umb.edu Walks-in: Please visit The One Stop for all inquiries related to Billing Teller Hours Hours: Monday – Thursday: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Friday: 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Internal Business for Departments Email: BursarTreasury@umb.edu Hours: Monday – Thursday 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
