Healey Library's electronic resources are available online through UMBrella and can be accessed using your campus email username and password, rather than the legacy method of logging in with a “library barcode.” InterLibrary Loan and ILLiad are also accessed via the university’s single sign-on method (SSO). Email accounts are created automatically upon enrollment or employment. Read more about email activation here . Affiliate Users (Sponsored Affiliates/Contingent Workers) Campus departments can grant Affiliate User status to individuals working as consultants, community partners, or in interinstitutional collaborations. University policies and licensing arrangements require that a Contingent Worker status be established for these individuals. The sponsoring department should arrange for this status by following the process outlined through Contingent Workers section of the Human Resources Forms page. The Contingent Worker Status must be created for the Affiliate User to appear in the library system before access to services can be granted.
