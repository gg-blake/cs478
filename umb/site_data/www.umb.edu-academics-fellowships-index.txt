Apply to Fellowships Wondering when to apply for fellowships? As a general timeline, we recommend that students begin the application process at least 2-3 months before the deadline, ideally aiming for 6 months ahead of time. This will give you ample time to prepare all the required materials and submit your application on time. We advise requesting recommendation letters from your faculty at least 2-3 months before the deadline, and to complete drafts of your application essays during the same timeframe. You should also request transcripts from all institutions attended at least 1 month before the deadline. To ensure that your application is complete, please make sure to include all required materials, such as letters of recommendation, letters of affiliation, transcripts, essays, and portfolios. By following these guidelines and starting your application process early, you can maximize your chances of receiving a fellowship award.
