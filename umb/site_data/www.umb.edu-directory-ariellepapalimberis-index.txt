During her time at Connecticut College, Arielle developed an interest in researching the social implications of having mental or behavioral difficulties while in educational systems. This interest was supported by her experience working as an intern for Dr. Jennifer Platt, through which she worked with school aged children and adolescents who had mental or behavioral disorders. With the guidance of Dr. Jefferson Singer, Arielle completed an honors thesis investigating how college students’ perceptions of romantic relationships are influenced by attachment styles, childhood memories of parental relationships, and social factors present on college campuses. She is very excited to join the CSDE and to contribute to making educational environments more inclusive for all children, both with and without disabilities.
