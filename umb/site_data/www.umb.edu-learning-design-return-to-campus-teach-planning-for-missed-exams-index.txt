I think the idea could be adapted to team projects in other science lecture or lab courses or in language learning, performing arts, or other subjects where students can collaborate to produce a novel outcome. In the chemistry course, pairs of students chose either taking apart a common battery to figure out how it operates as an electrochemical cell ( project option 1 ) or analyzing acid-base properties of a medicine at home ( project option 2 ). All experiments could be done in the kitchen at home with household materials. Partners found a mutually available time and did the experiments together in zoom. I set up the grading as team projects in Blackboard with a rubric and provided grading instructions for TAs including how to record feedback and scores in Blackboard." -Hannah Sevian (Professor, Department of Chemistry, and Associate Provost) UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
