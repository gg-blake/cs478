We strive to build community and foster students’ belonging through a cohort model as well as extracurricular activities. Most importantly, we center our work on listening to our students' narratives to gain comprehensive knowledge about who they are and to support their progress throughout their time at UMB. Vision Our vision is to continue to expand our program offerings to diverse student populations and our Boston communities. We strive to promote and strengthen equitable and inclusive practices and foster culturally sustaining pedagogies and advising practices. As a department, we want to continue to expand our model for tutoring and advising across our programs in order to cultivate meaningful learning communities and prepare our students for the academic and non-academic demands of undergraduate and graduate studies. We hope to build upon information-sharing procedures across campus units to strengthen the advising process for students and to eliminate institutional barriers. We are committed to staying up to date with programmatic practices that ensure the streamlining of our pathway programs.
