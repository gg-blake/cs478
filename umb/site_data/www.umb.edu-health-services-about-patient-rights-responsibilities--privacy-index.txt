Your privacy and trust are paramount to us at UHS. Protecting Access to Confidential Health Information (PATCH) Act Effective July 1, 2018, patients in Massachusetts gained enhanced privacy protections for safeguarding their healthcare information. This includes the ability to request confidentiality for sensitive services if they are covered under another person's health insurance plan, such as a guardian or spouse. PATCH Act Infographic | Fenway Health Key Privacy Protections The new law provides the following protections: EOB forms must now be addressed to the patient's name, even if they are a dependent on the insurance plan, rather than to the policyholder. Patients can choose their preferred method of receiving EOB forms, such as at a different mailing address or through an online portal. EOB forms will use general descriptions like "office visit" or "medical care" instead of specific details about sensitive services. Patients have the option to opt out of receiving an EOB form when there is no remaining cost-sharing for the healthcare visit or service. Services Covered Under PATCH These protections apply to a range of sensitive services, including: Mental Health Services Substance Use Disorder Services Gender Transition-Related Services Testing, Treatment, and Prevention of Sexual Transmitted Infections Testing, Treatment, and Prevention of HIV and AIDS Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B Testing and Treatment Reproductive and Contraceptive Services Fertility Services Abortion Services Pregnancy Testing and Counseling Sexual Risk Assessment and Services Related to Sexual Assault Domestic Violence Diagnosis and Services Management of Abnormal Pap Smears Diagnosis and Treatment of Vaginal Infections Prenatal Care How to Request PATCH Services To ensure your privacy under these new provisions, follow these steps: Locate your health insurance plan name and policy number (member number). Contact the customer service number on your health insurance card or visit your health plan's website. Request that the EOB form be sent directly to your address instead of to the policyholder, or opt to receive it only electronically. Your health plan may require a written request; they will provide instructions if needed. Sample Request Script "Hello, my name is [Your Name]. My policy number is [Your Policy Number]. I would like to request that information from my healthcare visit on [Date] at [Clinic Name] not be sent to my parents/spouse. Please send the EOB statement to [Your Address/Email]. Thank you!" Timing of Request It is best to make this request as soon as your health insurance begins and ideally before receiving any medical services. However, you can still request this change shortly after receiving care. Contact your insurance company promptly to confirm your request status or for further assistance. Additional Assistance For any questions or concerns, please call us at (617) 287-5660 and request to speak with one of our clinical staff or billing specialists. Your privacy is important to us at University Health Services, and we are here to support you in protecting your confidential health information. Language Line Translation Services University Health Services is committed to providing high-quality care to all patients, regardless of their primary language. We offer comprehensive translation services through Language Line Solutions to ensure effective communication and accommodate our diverse patient population. When scheduling an appointment or upon checking in, inform the receptionist that you require translation services and specify your preferred language. At the time of your appointment, your provider will utilize the Language Line to access a professional translator over the phone to facilitate communication between you and your provider.
