By queering these highly coded images, he makes work that converges on the concepts of longing, distance and the destructive impulse. Glaser is the instructional media specialist for sculpture and digital media in the Art Department and an instructor in the College of Advanced and Professional Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston. For the past five years, he has been the managing editor of Big Red & Shiny —a nonprofit arts organization and online art journal based in Boston that strives to create a living document of fine arts practices in New England through coverage and criticism. He is also an instructor at Bunker Hill Community College and the adjunct professor of grant writing and arts administration for the Visual and Performing Arts Department at Stonehill College. Glaser’s artwork has been exhibited nationally in venues like the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art in New York, 500X Gallery in Dallas, Texas, ArtSpace New Haven in New Haven, Connecticut, and the Mills Gallery at the Boston Center for the Arts in Boston.
