Her neurovascular exercise physiology research involves examination of the control of blood pressure, heart rate and blood flow to the kidneys during exercise in adult populations differing by age and racial identity and those with cardiovascular-related diseases. Her research team uses state-of-the-art, non-invasive measurement techniques such as Doppler ultrasound for kidney blood flow assessment, photoplethysmography for beat-to-beat blood pressure determination, and electrocardiography for beat-to-beat heart rate quantification, and analysis technique to evaluate spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability during exercise in populations with differing levels of cardiovascular risk.
