Our faculty and students make major contributions to understanding the potential for a healthy and productive coexistence between natural ecosystems and human economies. Our School for the Environment integrates the natural and social sciences to generate and apply new knowledge about the quality of our environment and the sustainable use of its resources. It focuses on promoting integrated science, planning, policy, and education for understanding earth-system processes and managing complex interactions between human activities (e.g., urbanization) and natural processes (e.g., carbon cycling) in linked watershed and coastal marine systems. The school's strong transdisciplinary makeup (natural and social sciences within the same department) and its focus on linked watershed-coastal systems are unique in the country.
