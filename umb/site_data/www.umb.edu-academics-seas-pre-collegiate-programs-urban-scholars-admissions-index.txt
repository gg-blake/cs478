Meet the School and GPA Requirement In order to apply for the Urban Scholars Program, a student must be enrolled in one of our partner schools: Jeremiah E. Burke High School, TechBoston Academy, Excel High School, Dearborn STEM Academy, or Boston International Newcomers Academy. Students do not need to have the top grade point average to participate in our Program. You can make a competitive application based on your desire, leadership potential, work ethic and other talents. You will be expected to keep your grades above a B (3.0) once you are admitted into our Program. 2. Attend an Information Session. Once nominated, students are asked to participate in an informational session where they are given more details about the Program. This usually takes place at the student's school. 3. Submit an application. Submit an Urban Scholars Enrollment Application including essay. Applications should demonstrate strong academic potential. The program application can be downloaded. 4. Interview! One of our staff members will call you to set up an interview where you can meet staff members and discuss your application. 5. Qualifications: Along with a completed application, students should provide income verification documentation. The income information is used solely to determine qualifications and is not shared with anyone outside of Urban Scholars staff. For more information on any of these steps contact us by email at UrbanScholars@umb.edu or call 617.287.5830. 6. Become an Urban Scholar, and receive a stipend! "This program is like a job because we get paid and we gain knowledge." – Isaac Divers, Dorchester High School. Stipends are provided to Urban Scholar students so that their economic situations will not get in the way of participation. Stipends are distributed two or three times per semester and are dependent on students completing their required hours or programming.
