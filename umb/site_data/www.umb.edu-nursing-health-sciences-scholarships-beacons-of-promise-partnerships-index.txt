Our partnerships foster a collaborative relationship allowing nursing education to inform nursing practice and patient care delivery, and in turn, nursing practice to inform nursing education, thus enhancing both professional practice and nursing education in an ever-changing health care environment. The joint Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is the only nursing post-doctoral program co-developed by a School/College of Nursing and a clinical partner as well as the only program which focuses on oncology care, health disparities, and health policy. It is designed to ensure a diverse and highly trained workforce to meet the national need for nursing faculty and researchers committed to better understand and address cancer health disparities. Finally, Dedicated Education Units (DEU) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown, South Shore Hospital, and Veterans Administration Hospital in Bedford are a model for education innovation designed to increase capacity and quality in nursing education programs, address faculty and nursing shortages, and bridge the gap between service and academia.
