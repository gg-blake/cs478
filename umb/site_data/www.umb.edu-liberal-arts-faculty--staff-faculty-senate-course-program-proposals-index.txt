THERE IS A NEW PROCESS COMING over the summer of 2021, a software called Curriculog, which will handle these governance matters Univeristy-wide. Please get in touch with Louise Putnam for more information but feel free to take a look at the program via this link (it utilizes Single-Sign-On protocols, so enter your umb.edu email and password). In the fall of 2021, we will be using the Curriculog software, for all things previously handled by both the OneFrom (course matters which were directed to the CLA Academic Affairs Committee) and the Program Change Form (program matters which are directed to the CLA Senate Majors, Honors, Individual Majors, and Special Programs Committee). More information will follow along with training and support from the CLA Dean's Office. In the interim, please feel free to contact Louise, who will be happy to field your questions and comments.
