    UMass Boston Athletics UMass Boston senior lacrosse player Gil Del Valle has been named the recipient of the prestigious Yeardley Reynolds Love Unsung Hero Award, which recognizes the accomplishments of student-athletes who help their teams achieve success in ways that may not be measured in goals, save or ground balls. "I am so proud of Gil, I can't think of anyone more deserving of this recognition. The joy and excitement that his coaches and teammates felt when learning that Gil received this recognition is a testament to what an incredible teammate and person he is," said head coach Tyler Low. Del Valle, a dedicated member of the Beacons program, is the first Beacon to ever receive the award, which was established in 2018 in honor and memory of Yeardley Reynolds Love, who was a senior at the University of Virginia and member of the women's lacrosse team. The award is given to a men's and women's lacrosse player in all three NCAA divisions. He is the first player from the Little East Conference to be honored. The Chelsea native is described as a selfless teammate determined to give back to his community. Del Valle came to the lacrosse world through Harlem Lacrosse and works full-time to help fund his education. Adjusting to full-time school, work, and lacrosse was tough, and Del Valle initially took a season away from lacrosse to focus on academics. He came back to the team more inspired than ever to be the best teammate, student, and community leader possible. Del Valle also finds the time to serve as game director for the nonprofit AWANA and as a resident assistant on campus. He founded a Student-Athletes of Color Coalition at UMass Boston that has now expanded to the entire Little East Conference. His goal is to become a first-grade teacher back in his hometown of Chelsea to give back to his community through education.
