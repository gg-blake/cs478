We seek people with a commitment to education for several types of part-time positions. Instructors Instructors teach between ten to fifteen high school students either twice a week after school during the academic year or in the mornings for 70 minute class periods during our Summer Institute. Potential instructors propose courses in a wide range of fields. We look to hire instructors who can not only inspire students but also can ensure students are steadily building the skills and knowledge base that will allow them to become successful college students. Instructors are hired three times a year to correspond with our semesters; however, Urban Scholars accepts applications all year round. We are currently hiring instructors for our summer program. Please review the instructor job description for more details and to learn how to apply. Tutors/Teaching Assistants (TAs) In addition to teachers, USP hires tutors for the academic year. These undergraduates, recent graduates, or graduate students play a major role in ensuring that each student experiences an inclusive, safe, and exciting year. Tutors provide 1-on-1 and small group tutoring for our students in the afternoons. If you are interested in becoming an academic year tutor, please complete an application and email it to urbanscholars@umb.edu. Each summer USP hires 8 summer teaching assistants (TAs). In the mornings, TAs help our lead teachers create a learning environment that maximizes learning. They manage materials and attendance while assisting with lessons, class discussions, and group work. In the afternoons, TAs lead a team of about 25 students in competitions, workshops, college-prep seminars, field trips, and more. We seek candidates from all majors who are committed to our mission and passionate about working with youth.
