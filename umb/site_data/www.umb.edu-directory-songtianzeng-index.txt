Additional Information To support “Whole Child” education, Zeng's research agenda focuses on evidence-based practices, teacher and parent training, and program quality improvement. These three lines of research are based on his belief that evidence-based practices (EBPs) may impact student outcomes if they are implemented with fidelity by well-prepared educators in high-quality inclusive settings. He supported program evaluation and quantitative data analysis in a number of federal and stated funded research projects at the University of Washington Childcare Quality and Early Learning Center for Research and Professional Development, the National Center on Quality Teaching and Learning, and the Center for Strong Schools.
