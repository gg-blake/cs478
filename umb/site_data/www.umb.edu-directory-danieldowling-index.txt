Our research focuses on two main areas: Challenging chemistry in natural product biosynthesis. We are particularly interested in heterocycle formation within nonribosomal peptide synthetases and complex free-radical chemistry involved in natural product biosynthesis. Posttranslational or posttranscriptional modifying enzymes with implications in treating different diseases. Current work focuses on kinases and metallo-deacetylases.
