Additional Information Background Dr. Rouhana was born and raised in Mexico, where his father and maternal grandparents settled after leaving Lebanon. Dr. Rouhana's family moved to Texas when he was a teenager.  He attended the University of Texas at El Paso and earned a B.S. in Biology.  After graduating, Dr. Rouhana attended the Genetics Ph.D. program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and earned a doctoral degree under the mentorship of Dr. Marvin P. Wickens.  After postdoctoral training at the University of Illinois and the Kyoto University, he began an independent position as Assistant Professor at Wright State University.  Eight years later, Dr. Rouhana joined the Department of Biology at UMass Boston, where he continues to study regeneration, development, and regulation of gene expression. Research Interests The Rouhana laboratory uses planarian flatworms to uncover genetic mechanisms behind germline development and stem-cell driven regeneration.  The lab is particularly interested in post-transcriptional regulatory events that orchestrate developmental processes.
