For this course, students work on a volunteer basis for ten to fifteen hours per week during the semester in a supervised field placement (Total of 150 hours) related to their areas of interest in women's, gender, and sexuality studies. Simultaneously, students meet in a weekly seminar to discuss the progress of the intern work, evaluate field learning, and to examine topics such as the ideology and structure of the helping professions, human services and social change, dynamics issues in feminist nonprofit organizations, and applications of feminist theory of social change in real-world organizational settings.

The honors designation “Distinction in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies” accompanies the Book Award, and the recipient’s name is listed in the Honors Convocation booklet. Women’s Studies Founders Award The Women’s Studies Founders Award for Academic Excellence and Social Activism was initiated by Mary Anne Ferguson, Professor Emerita of English and Women’s Studies, in 1990-91. Since that time, it has been supported both by her continuing contributions, and by gifts from many other faculty, alumnae, and friends of the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department. One, or sometimes two, monetary prizes are made each year at the CLA Honors Convocation to winners of the Founders’ Award. Graduating Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies majors are invited to apply for the award each year by submitting a personal statement, along with two letters of reference: one from a professor familiar with the applicant’s academic work, and one from someone with knowledge of the student’s record of social activism. A faculty committee reviews the applications and chooses the away recipients. Social activism is defined broadly in determining eligibility for the award. Frequently, the recipients of the award have performed services for the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department and other organizations on campus, as well as community-based work through internships, volunteering, and occasionally paid employment. Political and cultural activism, educational outreach, and social service work on behalf of women and girls are all included in the histories of our Founders’ Award recipients. Award recipients have also been concerned with poverty, homophobia, and other social issues.
