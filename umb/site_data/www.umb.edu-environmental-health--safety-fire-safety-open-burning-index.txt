It is always necessary to get approval permits from both the Fire and Inspectional Services Departments. WITHOUT THE TWO PERMITS YOU CANNOT HAVE AN OUTDOOR COOKOUT ON CAMPUS. The steps you must take to obtain these permits are summarized below. Boston Health Department (BHD) Inspectional Services Unit 617.635.5326.

Boston Fire Prevention Department (BFD) 617.343.2187 Contact Lt. Hansen. A permit for the use of propane must be obtained from this department. You must present both the (1) inspectional services permit and (2) a letter from the "owner" of the property (the Chancellor or her designee) indicating her knowledge of the cooking activity and details of the cookout event. The permit fee is based on the amount of propane used - one, 20 cubic feet container costs $5.00, two or more containers cost an additional $25.00.
