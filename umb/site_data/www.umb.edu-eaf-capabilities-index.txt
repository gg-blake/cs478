Contact us at EACF@umb.edu with questions about any of the services and instrumentation you see listed here. Chemical Analysis The EACF specializes in the elemental chemical analysis of environmental samples and critical materials by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Environmental samples can include waters, sediment, soils, rocks, and biological tissues, whereas manufactured critical materials include batteries, computer chips, semi-conductors, magnets, chemotherapy drugs , and other pharmaceuticals, among others. The EACF has two ICP-MS instruments (Perkin Elmer NexION 2000 quadrupole instrument and Nu Instrument Attom ES, double focusing, sector field instrument). The EACF provides expert analyses of the rare earth elements , with emphasis on the lanthanide series elements as well as other critical metal(loids) like tungsten , antimony , gold , silver , and rhenium . The EACF is well suited for studies of critical minerals and potentially toxic trace elements including arsenic , lead , chromium , among others. Critical minerals research is crucial for the high-tech and green energy initiatives important for a circular economy. The elemental analyses capabilities also include laser ablation of environmental and manufactured materials for surface chemical analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ICP-MS for metal and metalloid speciation analysis of environmental samples. Nutrient Analysis We can provide several solutions to your nutrient analysis questions and needs. Macronutrients such as nitrogen species, phosphate , and silica can be measured in environmental water samples by either one of the EACF’s two ion chromatographs , by UV-Vis spectrophotometry , or flow injection analysis , depending on your detection limit requirements. Chlorophyll can also be quantitively measured in water samples using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. SEM-based Materials Science Analysis The scanning electron microscope (SEM) within the EACF imaging laboratory provides an ideal tool for characterizing material properties down to 1 micron in size. The coupled energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) allows for qualitative analysis of the chemical composition of these materials, with the option of developing element maps of the material’s surface. Microplastics Microplastics formed by the breakdown of manufactured plastic products are ubiquitous in the environment. Let us help you to identify the composition of microplastics in your samples using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy within the EACF imaging laboratory.
