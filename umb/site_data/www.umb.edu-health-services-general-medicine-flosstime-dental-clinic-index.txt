Frequently Asked Questions Is it free? As long as you have active dental insurance, routine dental services such as cleanings, x-rays, and exams are typically covered 100% , meaning there is no out-of-pocket expense due to you. However, coverage may vary by plan. Where is the dental clinic located? FlossTime’s clinic is located inside the Quinn Administration Building, second floor, within University Health Services. How do I know if I am covered for my appointment? After filling out your new patient forms, FlossTime will verify your insurance coverage. They will inform you of any out-of-pocket costs before your appointment. What is the cancellation policy? By making an appointment, patients agree to the following: If the New Patient forms are not filled out within 48 hours, the dental appointment may be canceled. Failure to respond to texts or calls from FlossTime requesting new patient paperwork will result in appointment cancellation. Patients are required to fill out each dental form completely, with the correct information, and skipping any New Patient forms is not an option. All appointment cancellations/changes must be made 48 hours in advance to avoid a fee. Any canceled appointments within 48 hours will require a $60 cancellation fee.
