Authentic Assessment Authentic assessment can be a helpful tool in preventing students from cheating when using ChatGPT or other Generative AI tools. Authentic assessment refers to assessments that measure students' understanding of the material in a real-world context, rather than just memorization or regurgitation of facts. Here are a few ways that authentic assessment can help prevent cheating: Assessing application, not just recall: Authentic assessments typically require students to apply their knowledge to real-world situations or scenarios. This type of assessment requires a deeper understanding of the material, rather than just memorization. Because of this, it can be more difficult for students to cheat by relying solely on ChatGPT or other AI language models to provide answers. Focusing on process, not just product: Authentic assessment often involves a process of inquiry or investigation, rather than just a final product. This process can be more difficult to cheat on, as it requires students to engage with the material in a more meaningful way. Additionally, authentic assessment can be designed in a way that makes it difficult for students to simply copy and paste answers from ChatGPT. Incorporating student choice and creativity: Authentic assessment often allows for more student choice and creativity, which can make it more difficult for students to cheat. By allowing students to choose their own topics or projects, for example, they are less likely to find pre-made answers on ChatGPT that they can simply copy and paste. Overall, authentic assessment can be a valuable tool in preventing cheating when using ChatGPT or other AI language models. By designing assessments that require deeper understanding, focus on process, and incorporate student choice and creativity, instructors can help ensure that students are engaging with the material in a meaningful way and not just relying on AI for answers. Data Protection Generative AI language tools learn from the material they are exposed to from the users. We recommend that you use these tools to collect general information for your educational needs, but not provide the AI tool with materials unpublished or proprietary educational materials, as they could then be used to answer another person’s question. There are ways that both students and instructors can protect their data when using AI-powered platforms: Read the privacy policy : Before using any AI-powered platform, students and instructors should read the platform's privacy policy to understand how their data will be collected, stored, and used. They should also look for platforms that are transparent about their data collection and use policies. Be mindful of sharing data : Students and instructors should be cautious about sharing novel ideas, personal, or professional data on AI-powered platforms that aren't previously published or copyrighted. Use the Generative AI tool as a tool to collect information for you, not a tool that collects your information. Learning Opportunities Learning Design AI Series Video Playlist Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is ChatGPT? ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence model that can generate text based on a user’s input. ChatGPT can interact in a conversational way, answer questions, write text, and learn from feedback. There are other language models similar to Chat GPT, such as Bing Chat, Gemini (formerly Bard), and Claude.AI. What tools do UMass Boston faculty and students have access to? The university doesn’t have provide any Generative AI site-wide licenses. Chat GPT, Bing Chat, Bard and Claude.AI all currently offer free accounts. Those accounts are limited in availability based on traffic and capacity, with preference given to paid users. How can I get access to ChatGPT? To access ChatGPT go to open.ai.com . Click ‘Try ChatGPT’ to get an account. Once you have an account, select ‘Log in’. If you cannot log in to your free account it is most likely that the use is high at the moment and preference is given to paid account users (Chat GPT Plus). It has been said that more thorough responses are given to paid users using the same prompts as free users. How can I get access to Bing Chat? To access Bing Chat, you have to use Microsoft Edge Browser . Once downloaded and installed, Open Microsoft Edge Browser, click the search bar and select Get Started after the Bing introduction.

Is there a technology that can detect the use of ChatGPT or other Generative AI tools? There are a number of free tools available, including GPTZero, which are programmed to detect a number of different AI models. ​​However, these tools are not always accurate when it comes to distinguishing human-written from AI-generated content. If you're concerned about the authenticity of student content, always apply critical thinking, check the source, and if possible, verify information through multiple channels. Is it appropriate to enter student work into ChatGPT to generate feedback, or for students to enter their work into ChatGPT? If the paper or work is about a commonly discussed topic, entering it in ChatGPT or another Generative AI product is okay. However, if the student work is part of a thesis or dissertation, we recommend not entering the work in its entirety. You can prompt using a paraphrase of the work, asking it what it thinks of a topic in general. However, we recommend caution to protect the student’s proprietary information.
