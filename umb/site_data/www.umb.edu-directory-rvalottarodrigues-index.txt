My mission is to leverage the next generation of wind energy systems. In my research, I focus on wind farms flow physics across multi-fidelities, design, and multidisciplinary optimization. Before joining UMass Boston, I spent 3 years working as Researcher in the Systems Engineering and Optimization, Wind and Energy Systems Department, Technical University of Denmark (DTU). During that time, I had the opportunity to work in multiple R&D in collaboration with wind energy companies that are leaders worldwide. Additionally, I have a Postdoctoral in Mechanical Engineering at Syracuse University. I complete my academic background with a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, a R1 university in Denver, Colorado (USA). Before than that, I did my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Campinas, which is the top-2 among all Brazilian universities and the top-1 South American research institution. At the same university, I did an industrial Master in Agricultural Engineering, focusing on deploying and simulating a small hybrid solar-wind power system at the University of Campinas.
