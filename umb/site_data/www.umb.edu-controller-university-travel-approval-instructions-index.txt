Completed forms must be uploaded to the Travel Request. Submit your Travel Request.  Approvers will review and determine if additional information is needed. Book your travel once the Travel Request has been approved. Booking through the UMass Travel Management Company (TMC) is strongly recommended. Travel can be booked through the TMC in Concur. Register your travel. Travel booked in Concur through the TMC is automatically registered.  If you booked your travel in Concur through the TMC, that means no other action is required of you. If you did not book your travel in Concur through the TMC, you must register your travel by submitting travel itinerary information to Healix Sentinel.  Detailed instructions are available under the Travel Registration: How Do I Register My Travel? section. If you are registering group travel, visit the Travel Registration: Registering Group Travel section for detailed instructions. If you do not have an official itinerary for your travel (e.g. driving a personal vehicle and staying with a friend), please send your travel dates and address of your meeting location to the Travel and Expense team at travelexpense-services@umassp.edu to have your travel manually registered. Enjoy your trip!
