University Travel Most University Travel requires prior approval, also known as pre-travel authorization.  University Travelers must submit a request to travel in Concur for all overnight, out-of-state, and international University Travel. Approval must must be obtained by the Traveler prior to booking travel. All international travel will require Export Control review.  Any travel to High-Risk Destinations will be subject to High Risk Review by the High Risk Travel Review Committee.  All approvals are facilitated through Concur. A High-Risk Destination is any domestic or international country, region, province or city designated by the Systemwide Travel Risk Management Advisory Committee (TARMAC) or a campus as posing substantive health, safety, security risk to a University Traveler and/or the University.  High-Risk Destinations are inclusive of comprehensively sanctioned countries.  For the most up-to-date list of High-Risk Destinations, visit the Pre-Travel Authorization page under the "Requirements for Travel to High-Risk or Elevated Cybersecurity Risk Destinations" section. A copy of the list is also available here . Personal Travel with a University Device or Accessing University Data All Travelers seeking to bring University Devices, Data or Property on University Travel to an Elevated Cybersecurity Risk Destination must submit a pre-travel authorization request in Concur and attach a completed International Pre-Travel Export Control and Risk Form .  Please note: this is the same form required for all requests to International Travel Destinations and High-Risk Travel Destinations. When should I register? Travel requests must be submitted 21 days before departure, or as soon as travel dates are known. Travel requests to high risk destinations should be submitted 30 days in advance of departure, or upon notice of change in the systemwide list of High-Risk Destinations. Need Help?
