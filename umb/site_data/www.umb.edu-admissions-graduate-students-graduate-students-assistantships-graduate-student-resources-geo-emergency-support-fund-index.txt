Purpose of the GEO Emergency Support Fund: The GEO Emergency Support Fund provides small grants up to $500 (which are taxable income to the recipient), to active dues-paying union members for temporary one-time emergency situations including (but not limited to) those that arise as a result of theft, natural disaster, food or housing insecurity or financial insecurity and barriers to educational access caused by external policy changes. The fund is not meant to cover ongoing costs such as university tuition and fees and living expenses. The GEO Emergency Support Fund requests are intended to be for one-time events and subsequent requests will only be considered in different circumstances from the first request. As such, subsequent requests may be subject to increased review and priority may be given to members who have not yet made use of these funds. Examples of Approved Requests Replacement of school equipment or books due to theft or natural disaster; cost of food or temporary living expenses due to natural disasters, accidents, housing problems, or domestic violence; visa renewal; or legal representation related to immigration or other forms of discrimination. Applicants may be contacted by a staff member from the Office of Graduate Studies and can be referred to the Dean of Students Office or U-Access to discuss whether they would like to have a benefits screening. U-Access serves students who are experiencing temporary homelessness, emancipation from foster care, chronic poverty, and chronic hunger. Completing the Form Please include all information requested. Supporting documentation should include any information that will support statements in your narrative. For example, if you state that you have lost your job, please include any emails or other communication which show that you have lost your employment.
