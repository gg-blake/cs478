There are several UMass Boston departments involved in building evacuations. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS), in collaboration with building occupants, the UMB Police Department, and the Office of Emergency Management, have developed these plans based upon the unique characteristics of each academic and service building.  The Office of Housing and Residential Life has developed that buildings plan based on its unique characteristics. If occupants are familiar with evacuation procedures, then threats to life and property will be minimized in the event of an emergency.
