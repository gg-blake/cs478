Tri-University Veteran Retention & Graduation Rates A Tri-University Veteran Retention and Graduation Rates Study, sponsored by the William Joiner Institute was initiated during the summer of 2023 to look at programs, services, and organizational structures and their impact on recruitment, retention, and graduation rates at UMB, UCONN, and UTA. VSO & Veteran Connections (Commonwealth-Research) The VSO and Veteran Connections study will collect and analyze the challenges faced by VSOs in the Commonwealth. At the same time, the study will work to create an expanded network amongst veterans to help identify impediments to their success and well-being. The findings will be used to support VSOs in providing resources and services to Massachusetts veterans, and broaden veteran connectivity and interaction.
