As such, it’s a great place to look for UMass Boston official reporting data. The CDS is especially helpful if you need a “quick fact” that isn’t covered in our Fast Facts such as UMass Boston’s current student to faculty ratio. Please contact our office if you would like help navigating the CDS or if you’re interested in a workshop for CDS users.
