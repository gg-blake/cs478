ANNOUNCEMENT: Important Update Regarding Malign Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs (MFTRPs) Important updates to our collective responsibilities under federal regulations and University policy, particularly concerning participation in Malign Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs (MFTRPs). The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and subsequent federal agency policies—including those from the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department of Defense (DoD)—impose strict prohibitions on participation in MFTRPs for all individuals engaged in federally funded research. The University of Massachusetts  needs  to be fully compliant with these  requirements for continued eligibility for federal funding. Under the university’s Conflicts Policy, the Conflicts Committee has been expressly delegated powers from the Board of Trustees to manage conflicts of interest in the research enterprise. At its regularly scheduled meeting on August 8, 2024, the Conflicts Committee voted to approve the language linked below as an advisory and policy statement of the Conflicts Committee.
