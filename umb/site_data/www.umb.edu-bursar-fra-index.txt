Our goals is to help students understand the cost of their education and the financial policies associated with their enrollment at UMass Boston. Students are directed to the FRA agreement page when they log in their WISER. The FRA must be accepted and completed by students when they log in their WISER, in order to register for Fall 2024 semester. You could view / print the FRA agreement from the following link. (* The FRA must be accepted once per academic year). Student Financial Responsibility Agreement Students will be directed to the Financial Responsibility Agreement (FRA) page when they log in their WISER . If students do not accept the FRA at the time they log in, they will be redirected back to the FRA page when they log back in their WISER.
