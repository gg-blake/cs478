He recently completed a postdoctoral fellowship focused on the intersection of diabetes, physical activity and cancer at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City Utah under the mentorship of Drs. Sheetal Hardikar, Jennifer Ose and Cornelia Ulrich. As a part of this fellowship Dr. Viskochil was involved in the implementation, collection and analysis of accelerometer-based physical activity and sedentary behavior in the ColoCare Study, a large, international cohort of colorectal cancer patients. Additionally, Dr. Viskochil carried out several research projects designed to investigate the mechanisms and persistence of diabetes development in recently-diagnosed cancer patients. He is looking forward to expanding these research areas at UMass Boston by implementing physical activity interventions specifically designed to prevent diabetes in cancer patients and survivors, especially in underserved populations who may not have access to adequate survivorship resources. He is also very excited about the opportunity to collaborate with other investigators throughout campus and the greater Boston Community. In his free time Dr. Viskochil enjoys golf, traveling and singing extremely poor renditions of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone,’ the anthem of his beloved Liverpool soccer team.
