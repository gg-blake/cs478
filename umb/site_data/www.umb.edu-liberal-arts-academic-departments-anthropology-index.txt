We ask questions about why people do, think, and believe what they do, and offer explanations or interpretations embracing cultural and historical frameworks. Anthropology helps students understand the cultural and economic connections that link people, neighborhoods, nations, and the global system. Looking at the biological side of our human adaptation, we try to understand how our social and cultural environments "get under the skin" to affect health and well-being, as well as studying human biological variation and evolution.
