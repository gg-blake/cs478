Each group is different depending on its focus, and all provide interesting lifelong learning opportunities as well as fun social experiences. OLLI SIGs are independent and self-managed with members deciding when they will meet and planning how the group will function. Initially, members volunteer to be leaders or co-leaders, and leadership roles may rotate. Volunteers also handle administrative and communication details. Most SIGs meet once a month although they may meet more or less often if members wish. The OLLI office provides meeting space at UMass although a group may decide to meet outside the UMass Boston campus. OLLI currently has seven active Shared Interest Groups. Some have been meeting for many years, and others are recent startups. Some SIGs would welcome new members while others are not accepting new members at this time. With support from OLLI’s Curriculum Committee, new OLLI SIGs can be formed.
