We showcase the physics approach to problem-solving and pattern recognition through cross-disciplinary offerings. Academic Programs Undergraduate Programs Engineering Physics BS Physics BS Physics BA Physics Minor Graduate Programs Applied Physics MS Applied Physics PhD About Our Department In the minds of many students, physics is often conflated with mathematics and to counter this view our program design places strong emphasis on the empirical motivation behind physical concepts. This is implemented both through experimental and computational courses as well as a growing number of cross-disciplinary offerings which serve to illustrate the physical approach to problem solving and the recognition of patterns. The research interests of our faculty all reside under a common rubric of “the physics of systems away from equilibrium” and many of these interests are manifested in the cross-disciplinarity seen in the curriculum.
