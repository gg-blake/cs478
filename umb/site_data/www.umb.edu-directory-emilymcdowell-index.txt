While at Tufts, she worked as a research assistant in the psychology department and was very involved in Best Buddies, a nonprofit organization that facilitates friendships between people with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities. At the CSDE, McDowell has been involved with several projects related to the evaluation of Special Olympics programming, including the national evaluation of the Unified Champion Schools program, as well as a comprehensive study of Special Olympics Texas athletes and families. She has also assisted with the development of an Evaluation Guide to help Special Olympics evaluate their school-based programming. Currently, McDowell is coordinating a project that aims to establish standards for inclusion in recreation programs. Funded by the National Inclusion Project, and supported by a team of researchers and practitioners from across the country, this project will ultimately lead to the development and implementation of an accreditation process for inclusive camps and community programs at the national level.
