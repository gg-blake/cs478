Begin your chemistry journey as you study the matter that makes up our universe. The department requires 46 credits in chemistry, including the following courses: Chem 115 and 117; Chem 116 and 118 (Principles of Chemistry I and II, and labs) Chem 251 and 255; Chem 252 and 256 (Organic Chemistry I and II, and labs) Chem 311 and 313; Chem 312 and 314 (Analytical and Physical Chemistry, and labs) Chem 369 and 379 (Chemical Structure, and lab) Chem 370 and 371 (Inorganic Chemistry, and lab) Chemistry Capstone requirement (see below) In addition, the Chemistry Department requires two semesters of Calculus (MATH 140, 141) which should be taken as early in the academic career as possible, as subsequent chemistry and physics courses have calculus as a pre- or co-requisite. Two semesters of Calculus-Based Physics (PHYS 113, 114) and Physics Lab (PHYS 181, 182) are also required, and should be taken as early in the academic career as possible, as subsequent chemistry courses have physics as a pre-requisite. Capstone Requirement: Students majoring in Chemistry must, during their senior year, register for CHEM 491/492 (Senior Thesis). This yearlong course will require the student to undertake a research project, either in the laboratory or literature-based research, culminating in the preparation of a research paper of significant length. The student will also present the work orally at the end of the year. Research topics must be approved by the faculty mentor before research begins. A grade of at least "C" in the capstone is required for graduation. Please note: Students majoring in Biochemistry may not also major in Chemistry.
