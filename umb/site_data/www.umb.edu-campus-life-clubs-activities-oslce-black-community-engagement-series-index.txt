The series was developed and launched to uplift Black and Brown communities within the greater Boston through community engagement. The series is a compiled list of opportunities for students to engage and assist with non-profit organizations and private agencies that assist with serving Black and Brown communities. Please take a look below at our programs and opportunities that compose our Black Engagement Series. Goals: To build a more unified connection between the UMass Boston Campus and the Black/Brown communities within the greater Boston area. Provide opportunities for UMass Boston students, staff, and faculty to engage in both activism and community engagement work. To actively break down systemic barriers that directly affect Black/Brown communities through engaging in fundamental projects and initiatives that operate as solutions to inequity and racism.
