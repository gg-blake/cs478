We are happy to announce the Care Guide , a brand new website designed to help students engage in self and community care created by UMB-UR-BEST! View the site at https://tinyurl.com/umbcareguide or https://sites.google.com/view/careguide/home It has resources you can use to care for yourself, your loved ones, and your communities. There are activities you can do right now, readings to help you explore how you think about caring, communities to connect to, and much more. These resources are meant for everyone but were made with students with diverse identities and circumstances in mind . This includes free resources, information about coping with discrimination, resources for parents and caregivers, and resources intended for many non-traditional or marginalized students.
