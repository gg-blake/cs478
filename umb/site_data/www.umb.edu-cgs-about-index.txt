To this end, the Center engages in rigorous and applied scholarship on real-world policy challenges related to the environment, development, and sustainability, advances inspirational education, and promotes honest dialogue among a diversity of stakeholders. The Center for Governance and Sustainability aims to facilitate thought and action for strengthening developmental and environmental policymaking at the global level. While accomplishing this goal entails rigorous research and analysis, we believe that it is critical to communicate findings and ideas to policymakers, scholars, and interested citizens.
