A beacon as you know is a light or a fire that acts as a signal to guide those that see it to a safe and secure place. If a student is a Beacon of Promise at the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, they have demonstrated the ability to undertake their educational work with focus and strength. At the same time, these students inspire others to move forward successfully in their careers. We at the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, envision our students’ success as primary investments in the lives of individuals, families, and communities. We are eternally grateful to the philanthropy that facilitates the journey of our students in their quest for educational progression toward graduation and beyond. Thank you!
