In order to keep university-owned computers secure, and to keep the sensitive data stored on them private, we have compiled the following list of standard software and configurations that are required for all university-owned computers. This list of software and configurations will be applied at the time that the computer is imaged by the IT Desktop group, before delivery to the end user. Defender for Endpoints (managed Anti-malware platform) Tenable.IO (or any vulnerability management platform) Intune (MDM) /Jamf (Patch Management) Admin By Request Hard Drive encryption Solid login password Screen lock with 3 to 5 minutes of inactivity VPN when in public Wi-Fi MFA (is implemented) Solid Identity management (Defender for Identity) If an item in this list interferes with a business need, inform the IT Desktop staff person working on your computer, and they will put you in touch with the ISO to discuss other potential options. This page is based on the UMass Boston Information Security Policies. To learn more, see that document linked at the top of the ISO Homepage. .
