Currently, our research involves community participatory, qualitative, and quantitative methods to examine the effects of disparate exposure to justice-contact and community violence for Black adolescents and state-induced migratory traumas for Haitian people. We also focus on developing and piloting anti-carceral and community based health interventions, such as the Association of Black Psychologists’ Sawubona Healing Circles to promote healing from an African-centered framework. Our advocacy involves connecting with local, national, and international coalitions to promote policy and community change.
