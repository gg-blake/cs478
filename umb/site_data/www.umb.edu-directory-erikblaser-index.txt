[Epub ahead of print] Additional Information Dr. Blaser studies human perception, specifically visual psychophysics. Some current studies focus on visual attention (how do you program your mental ‘autopilot’ for complicated visual tasks, such as driving?), depth and scale perception (might there be ‘clues’ to how big an object is, hidden in the texture on that object’s surface?), perceptual learning (when you learn a task, how should we characterize the underlying neural changes?), and cognitive development (which features - color, shape, size, texture - do infants rely on most for remembering and comparing ?). TEACHING: Perception (Psych 255); Advanced Visual Perception (Psych 451); Introduction to Cognitive Science (Psych/CS L271).
