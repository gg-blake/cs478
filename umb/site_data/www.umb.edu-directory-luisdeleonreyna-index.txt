Additional Information Luis De León is an evolutionary biologist broadly interested in understanding the processes that promote, maintain and constrain the diversity of life. He's also interested in how anthropogenic disturbances and global change could affect evolutionary processes in natural populations. He addresses these topics in the context of highly-diverse neotropical environments, which contain most of the Earth's biodiversity. Particularly, he focuses on organisms undergoing adaptive radiation such as Darwin's finches of the Galápagos (Ecuador) and freshwater fishes from Panama. He is also interested in expanding these topics to temperate organisms. Honors: Selected member of the National Research System (SNI) of Panama. Research associate at INDICASAT , Panama.
