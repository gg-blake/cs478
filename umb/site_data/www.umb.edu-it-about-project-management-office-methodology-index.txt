The Information Technology Project Management Methodology is designed to provide the organization project management capability based on a common language, a practical set of skills, and a robust methodology, with appropriate support tools for maximizing productivity and effectiveness in completing projects successfully, on time, and within budget.  The larger intention of this effort is to develop a standard for project management practices and procedures across all aspects of the institutional technology landscape.  The Project Management Methodology includes process documentation, templates, and other tools to assist the project managers and project teams in scoping, planning, and executing projects.
