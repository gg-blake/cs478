Its primary task is to attend to collegiate matters, and its actions and views are to be considered the official actions and views of the college. The Senate works closely with the CLA Dean. Its powers are subject to the authority of the Dean as well as the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, the Chancellor, the University President, and the Board of Trustees. Much of the Senate’s work consists of reviewing curricular matters—new and revised courses, program changes, etc. The Senate establishes and charges committees and reviews their work. It may initiate recommendations and advise the Dean and campus administrators, and it may speak for the college on a range of matters.
