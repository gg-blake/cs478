Students must be in their final academic year of coursework and be on track to graduate in the current or upcoming semester. Only undergraduate permanent residents of Massachusetts who are graduating this academic year may be considered for the GRAD Last Mile Scholarship. The fund is administered by the City of Boston, in collaboration with UMass Boston. Funding is competitive and existing financial aid packages may be reviewed and taken into consideration as part of the award process. Awards will vary based upon need, with a maximum grant amount of $2,500 per student . Priority will be given to students who have one or more of the following extenuating circumstances: A past due balance preventing your from registering or graduating Food/housing insecurity Unexpected Transportation costs or Technology needs If a student is selected for an award they will be encouraged to meet with an advisor to make sure they are on track for degree completion and/or connect to any other support services that may be appropriate to help the student reach degree completion. Award recipients will be asked to share with Office for Merit-Based Scholarships their post-graduation plans and how the funds have assisted them on their journey towards degree completion.
