There are a large number of different Linux distributions available; we support two: CentOS (a Red Hat derivative) and Debian . As much as possible, we will also support Debian derivatives (such as Ubuntu or Mint ). Most of the local HPC clusters run CentOS; most of the supporting servers (fileservers, etc.) run Debian.
