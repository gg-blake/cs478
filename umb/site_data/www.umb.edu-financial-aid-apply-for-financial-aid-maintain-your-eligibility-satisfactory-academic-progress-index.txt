Passing (P) grades will factor in to the pace and timeframe components but will not factor in to GPA. Failing (F) grades will factor in to all three components - GPA, pace, and timeframe. Taking a course as Pass/Fail will not give you an opportunity to improve your GPA. The Financial Aid Office evaluates Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward degree requirements annually at the end of each spring term or upon re-enrollment into the university.  Students enrolled in a certificate program are evaluated at the end of each term.  SAP is also reviewed at the end of each probationary period, if applicable to the student.  The review of a student’s SAP status is based on the entire academic record, even if the student did not receive financial aid for previous semesters of enrollment. Undergraduate students must meet each of the following SAP criteria: GPA: maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher Pace: complete 67% of all credits/competencies attempted (total earned credits/total attempted credits) Maximum Time Frame: attempt no more than 150% of the credits/competencies required of your degree program (max credits) Students who do not meet the minimum SAP requirements are not eligible to receive financial aid.  Financial aid applicants not meeting SAP standards will be sent an email notification to the official UMB email address.  Students have the right to appeal their ineligibility for financial aid when extenuating circumstances exist. The Financial Aid Advisory Committee will review all appeals. Incomplete appeals will not be considered. The SAP Appeal Process is for financial aid purposes only. It does not substitute for the university’s review of a student’s academic standing. Please note that students must complete a FAFSA in order to submit an SAP Appeal in WISER . Watch the video below for a full walkthrough of the SAP Appeal process, or see below for links to walkthroughs of individual steps.
