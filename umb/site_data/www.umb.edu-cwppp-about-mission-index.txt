In our work we employ an anti-racist and intersectional approach taking into account persistent systemic inequities relating to race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, socio-economic status, sexual preference, religion, and other identities. The center serves as a resource for women by providing: EDUCA TION :  The Center hosts the Gender, Leadership, and Public Policy online or on-campus graduate certificate program. This award-winning, "first-in-the-nation" graduate program has served more than 800 alumnae as a springboard to new and enhanced careers, advanced graduate study, and increasingly effective political activism. GLPP certificate students can apply for and continue into a Master of Public Affairs (MPA)-GLPP track program, and earn an MPA degree in only one additional year. RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS : Our research is designed to make a difference in the lives of women and their communities while also drawing the attention of policymakers to issues which directly affect women's lives. We also produce policy briefs for policymakers on a wide range of subjects. EVENTS : The Center conducts a range of public service programs open to both the university community and the general public. Panel discussions, debates, films and conferences focus on women's political leadership and empowerment, and on social issues of special concern to women. Connection and Collaboration Our educational activities, events, and research projects are typically conducted in collaboration with many types of organizations. We are available to provide program evaluations, commissioned research studies, policy briefs, and fact sheets. Read about our services.
