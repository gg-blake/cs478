The Financial Planner sheet places your individualized financial aid eligibility in the context of tuition and fees so that you know what you would be expected to pay. The top of your Financial Planner sheet includes some assumptions Financial Aid Services has made in determining your eligibility for financial aid. These assumptions are based on your admissions application and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Please contact The One Stop team if you would like to update any of the information listed. Watch Video Need help understanding the Financial Planner?
