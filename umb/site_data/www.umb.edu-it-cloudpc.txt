Overview Your "local" home computer's performance relies on its own hardware -- The physical memory (RAM), hard drive space, and processor (CPU) in your local pc can all be limiting factors in how your computer runs. Cloud PC give you access to a powerful Windows PC that isn't limited by your local pc's actual hardware. Just like Netflix lets you stream a movie as if you had the physical DVD, CloudPC lets you stream access to a powerful pc as if you had an expensive new computer at home. Power up your Chromebook, iPad, even an old laptop, with CloudPC! CloudPC functions as a separate computer to the one you're using it on, meaning sensitive data you save there is more secure than on your regular computer . Also, CloudPC opens some interesting doors for mapped shared drives; if you have a share drive that normally can only be accessed on camps, try mapping it to your CloudPC desktop. CloudPC comes with Windows 10, Microsoft Office suite, OneDrive sync client, and three web browsers. Additional software can not be installed on it. Note: Files saved to CloudPC will not be retained after logout. All files must be backed up to OneDrive to not be lost. Power up your home pc, with CloudPC!
