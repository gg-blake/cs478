The Gastón Institute hires undergraduate and graduate students to work on a variety of projects. Learn about the research taking place at the Gastón. The Latino Leadership Opportunity Program (LLOP) The Latino Leadership Opportunity Program is an academic enrichment and leadership development program offered by the Gastón Institute for UMass Boston undergraduate students. The LLOP offers undergraduate training in applied research and public policy analysis. Students in the program enroll in a research seminar where they enhance their analytical and leadership skills, learn how public policy is created, become proficient in public speaking, build strong teamwork abilities, meet with policymakers, and receive course credit for their successful completion of the program. This program has a strong history of success: many graduates are now employed in public policy positions or are enrolled in competitive graduate programs. Latino Studies minors who enroll in the LLOP receive credit toward a requirement.
