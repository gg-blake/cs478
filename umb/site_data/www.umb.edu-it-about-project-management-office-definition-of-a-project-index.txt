The UMass Boston Information Technology Project Management Methodology defines a project as: A unique endeavor (not repeated) Temporary, with a distinct beginning and end Defined by specific deliverables Conducted by a temporary team that exists for the duration of its execution Having a project manager who is responsible for its success Defined by identifying its starting point, the goals/objectives sought, and the route between them Operations by contrast are ongoing and repetitive.  Operational activities may repeat daily, monthly, annually, or on an as-needed basis, e.g., financial review, standard upgrades, hiring for a new position. When operations require a major change in process, input/output, or purpose, they may become projects until the change is complete.
