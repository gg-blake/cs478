Gain the skills to assist individuals with visual impairments to become safe, efficient, independent travelers. UMass Boston’s Orientation and Mobility Certificate focuses on training professionals to assist blind or visually impaired individuals to reach their goal of becoming safe, efficient, independent travelers. It’s designed for teachers and other professionals who want to work with people with visual impairment and help them lead safe, productive and independent lives. You’ll gain the skills necessary to evaluate needs of adults and children with visual impairments. You’ll also learn how to teach them how to use equipment, such as the long cane, and low vision aids, as well as the integration of a professionally trained dog guide so they may orient themselves and travel safely with confidence. Explore cutting-edge learning technologies and gain practical hands-on experience through fieldwork. Apply these skills to assist people of all ages in different settings — from state and federal agencies to public and private schools.
