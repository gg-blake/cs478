As part of the onboarding process, matches help to figure out who may have a better connection to start with than without the information and match. Matches also help new employees to meet more people around campus, than they normally would on their own. Actual experiences have shown that this helps the new staff member to become more accustomed to the division and campus quicker. The mentor/mentee process is optional to all new employees.
