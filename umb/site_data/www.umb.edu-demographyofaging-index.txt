What We Do. We are gerontologists and social scientists who work with cities and towns mainly across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, engaging their older populations in needs assessments and planning processes to address persistent issues facing older adults. We are committed to advancing aging equity by removing barriers to information and developing more culturally responsive outreach to older adults. We explore innovative models of program and service provision through Councils on Aging (COAs) and other partners, and we maintain a database of all COAs and senior centers in Massachusetts regarding their scope and operations. Focusing on social health, we provide technical assistance and evaluation support to community-based organizations undertaking projects to strengthen social connections across generations. As a part of the Gerontology Institute at UMass Boston, we mentor graduate and undergraduate students as research assistants.
