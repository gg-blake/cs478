This kind of early care and education requires bold, effective, and creative leaders with a shared vision who reflect the racial, cultural, and linguistic richness of our communities. Early Education Leaders amplifies the talent that already exists in the workforce to advance the field of early care and education. Founded in 2016, we drive systems change by investing in workforce and leadership development, research, and the larger early education ecosystem to cultivate effective leaders who reflect and represent their communities. We consistently and successfully make accessible, high-quality early care and education a reality for more children and families, while supporting the professional growth of a diverse workforce of early educators. As a result, Early Education Leaders is nationally recognized as a model of excellence. Mission Early Education Leaders drives systems change in early care and education so that all early educators, young children, and their families thrive. We invest in workforce and leadership development, research, and the larger early education ecosystem to cultivate leaders who reflect and represent their communities. Equity Statement Systems of early care and education workforce must center racial equity and better reflect communities. Leaders who come from the communities they serve have the skills, relationships, and experience necessary to lead change. This type of specialized knowledge combined with deep professional skill is essential for developing field-level solutions with measurable and sustainable impact. A racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse workforce has the skills, perspectives, and specialized knowledge to lead powerful change. Early Education Leaders works to remove the barriers that currently limit access to entrepreneurial leadership training and continuous quality improvement for many historically marginalized educators in early care and education.
