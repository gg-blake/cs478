This process will help you determine which writing courses you should take in your first year at UMass Boston. UMass Boston offers a variety of pathways to meeting the general education requirements for writing courses, including sections that offer extra support. Take the Guided Writing Placement here. Below are courses that this placement program will assist you with selecting: First-Year Seminar Requirement All students who enter UMass Boston with fewer than 30 credits are required to take a First-Year Seminar course. These four-credit seminars focus on critical thinking, writing, and reading. This guided self-placement process will help you decide which path to completion of the first-year seminar requirement is the best “fit” for you. Composition Requirement All UMass Boston students are required to take two semesters of composition: English 101 (Composition I) and English 102 (Composition II). A small number of students earn credit for composition courses before they enroll at UMass Boston via exam scores or transfer credits, but the vast majority of first-year students take both English 101 and English 102 at UMass Boston. This guided self-placement process will help you know what steps to take if you have already earned credit for English 101. Courses for English Language Learners UMass Boston’s ESL Program offers a range of courses that are led by instructors who have expertise in teaching multilingual students. This guided self-placement process will help you decide if a course taught by a multilingual writing expert would be the best choice for you.
