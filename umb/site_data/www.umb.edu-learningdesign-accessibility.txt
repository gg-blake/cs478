Our Learning Designers can help you create an inclusive learning community that is accessible to all students. Making coursework accessible is best done proactively by employing best practices in your course design. On this page you will find resources and guides to help you build course materials to benefit all students. Book a consult Create Accessible Materials Making Documents Accessible Making Multimedia Accessible Accessible PDFs Use Ally Multiple Means of Access Providing your course content in several formats improves the course for all students. For example, by presenting a lesson as both a recorded audio file and a text file, you’re not simply accommodating visually and audibly impaired students, you’re also giving every student options, so they can choose the learning method which best suits their needs. Beyond Access Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a helpful framework to rely on for designing an inclusive course, through three basic principles: Multiple means of representation Multiple means of action and expression Multiple means of engagement. Learn more about UDL from The Center for Universal Design in Education at the University of Washington. You Have (an) Ally in Blackboard Providing digital versions of your course materials through Blackboard is already a good start toward offering multiple means of access. Blackboard provides a helpful accessibility-check tool available in all courses – Ally – that detects inaccessible content in your course and provides guidance on how to make it accessible. Even better, Ally provides alternative formats of your course materials to your students. However, the alternative formats are as good as the original content you provide. Learn more about Ally.
