Patent Method for estimating and/or reducing uncertainty in reservoir models of potential petroleum reservoirs JS Gunning, ME Glinsky, CD White US Patent 7,254,091 Additional Information After completing his doctorate, Chris White worked for Shell Research and Development on reservoir characterization and numerical modeling. He then spent several years at The Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, working on statistical analysis of outcrop data and flow modeling. Chris spent over a decade at Louisiana State University, where he taught reservoir dynamics, natural gas engineering, porous media transport, numerical simulation and geostatistics. He has also worked as a consultant. Since arriving at U Mass Boston in 2020, Chris has taught “Dinosaurs, a Natural History” and “Earth’s Dynamic Systems”. His current research addresses geostatistics, optimization, mass transport, and geochemistry.
