Siperstein, Stuart J. Schleien, Martin E. Block, and Emily D. McDowell. This comprehensive resource is designed to help camp leaders and staff create inclusive programs that welcome campers of all abilities, guided by the newly developed "Standards for Inclusive Recreation Programs." Part I of the book addresses best practices in various aspects of camp, while Part II is a series of case studies about inclusive camps that represent both day and overnight programs across a range of organizational affiliations and geographical locations. Over the past decade, there has been a heightened focus on the inclusion of children and adolescents with disabilities alongside their peers without disabilities in recreation programs. Research shows that there are many benefits of inclusive camps, such as increased self-esteem and social connections for campers with disabilities, and greater patience and empathy among campers without disabilities. This book is an essential resource for anyone involved in the administration, planning, or implementation of camp programming, with a focus on helping camp leaders and staff create environments that intentionally foster inclusion for all children. Co-authored chapters represent decades of combined experience in the camping field, with perspectives and examples from major recreation organizations like the American Camp Association (ACA) and the Jewish Community Centers Association of North America (JCCA). Camp Shriver is one of seven camps and organizations highlighted in Part II on exemplary inclusive camps, with a chapter co-authored by Camp Shriver staff and specific examples of Camp Shriver’s inclusive practices. The full list of camps and organizations represented in Part II is below.
