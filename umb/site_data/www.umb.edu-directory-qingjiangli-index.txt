Additional Information Lab Website Lab Location: ISC-3560 Carbohydrate chemistry is an interdisciplinary field at the interface of chemistry and biology and mindsets of multidisciplinary collaboration are practiced in our research. While specialized in the chemical/enzymatic synthesis of carbohydrate molecules and methodology development, the research projects in the Li lab extent to their biological applications, especially in immunology and drug discovery. Here at UMB chemistry, the principles of green chemistry will also be integrated into our projects of methodology development.
