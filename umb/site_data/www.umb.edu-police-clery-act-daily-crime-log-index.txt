Daily Crime Log The purpose of the Daily Crime Log is to record criminal incidents and alleged criminal incidents that are reported to the UMass Boston Police Department. The UMBPD Daily Crime Logs are published in compliance with federal and state laws. The log consists of criminal incidents and alleged criminal incidents that occur within our Clery Act responsibility. Each log contains information about incidents — both alleged criminal and non-criminal offenses — which occurred on that day. The UMass Boston Police Department posts specific incidents in the Daily Crime Log within two business days, and reserves the right to exclude reports from the Daily Log under exigent circumstances. Incidents are listed in the Daily Crime Log in the order they are reported to the UMass Boston Police Department, which may differ from the date the incident occurred. The Daily Crime Log will contain a minimum of the last 60 days of activity. The Crime Log is maintained daily in hard copy and is available for view in the UMass Boston Department of Public Safety & Police in the Quinn Builiding.
