Her research broadly focuses on equity, justice, and access both at work and in pursuit of work. Specifically, she takes an intersectional approach to understanding the influence of oppression and marginalization on the academic and career development of women from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Her work has been published in scholarly outlets such as Sex Roles, Journal of Vocational Psychology, Journal of Diversity in Higher Education, and Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering. In addition to her scholarship, Dr. Wilkins-Yel addresses race- and gender-based inequities in STEM by developing culturally sustaining interventions through interdisciplinary research-practice-partnerships. Most notably, Dr. Wilkins-Yel founded and co-directs the multi-institutional I CAN PERSIST STEM Initiative, a liberatory counterspace designed to advance STEM persistence among women and girls of color in a manner that centers their thriving. To date, her work has been supported by approximately $5M in federal and private grant awards. Dr. Wilkins-Yel is a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER fellow, as well as the recipient of the APA Emerging Leader for Women in Psychology Award, and the Society for Counseling Psychology’s Early Career Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Counseling Psychology.
