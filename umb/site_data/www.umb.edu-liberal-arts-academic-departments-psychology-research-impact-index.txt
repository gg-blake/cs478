Social Neuroscience . doi:10.1080/17470919.2017.1407822 Research Opportunities for Students Research Training: Learning through laboratory experience An important part of preparing for Masters and PhD programs in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Cognitive Science is getting involved in research while you are an undergraduate. Most faculty maintain active research labs on campus that include students as assistants and collaborators. You can earn course credit for research by doing a Research Apprenticeship (Psych 286 or Psych 486). A Research Apprenticeship is a 7 hour per week commitment, but the time demands and schedule will vary from lab to lab and are often flexible.  Exactly what you will be doing during your apprenticeship - helping to monitor the eye movements of infants while you perform tests of their memory? helping to identify the genetic changes, in an animal model like the mouse, that accompany stress? - will depend on the lab in which you work. Next steps View a list of faculty looking for a Research Apprenticeship, Directed Study, and/or Honors Research student . Make sure to look at research interests and backgrounds of the psychology faculty to see where you think you’d be a good match. Typically, if the faculty member has an opening, an application and contact information will be provided. If not, feel free to reach out the faculty member directly (contact information is available on the faculty page). The faculty member will reply with further details. Be prepared to provide additional information (e.g. other experience/skills, your goals, your transcript, etc.). Please note that submitting an application is not a guarantee that you will be offered a spot. Often, there are more applicants than openings and sometimes there are prerequisites. You may need to apply to another lab and/or reapply in another semester. If you do find a potential match, you and the faculty member will agree on a ‘learning contract’ that will outline your duties (these will vary from lab to lab, but might include helping with data collection and interpretation) and how you will be assessed for a grade (again, this will vary from lab to lab, but might include presentations, evidence of professional development, and/or a research paper). Ultimately, the faculty member will provide you with a permission number that you can use on Wiser to sign-up. Psych 286 Introductory Research Apprenticeship Description : Prerequisites: PSYCH 100, or PSYCH 101, and PSYCH 201 The course, a 200-level Research Apprenticeship (PSYCH 286) is designed for students who are interested in being involved in hands-on research, but who are still at the beginning of their studies in the major. Students who are enrolled in this course work with faculty members on topics related to the faculty member's research interests. Course Catalog. Psych 486 Research Apprenticeship in Psychology Description: Prerequisite: PSYCH 100, or PSYCH 101, PSYCH 201, or PSYCH 370, and THREE additional PSYCH courses This course is designed to provide undergraduate majors in psychology with opportunities to participate in empirical research under the direction of a full-time faculty member. Students may be involved in all aspects of research including review of the literature, selection of tasks and measures, preparation of experimental protocols, data collection, coding and analysis. This course is open only to psychology majors. Course Catalog.
