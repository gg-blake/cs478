We always attempt to design a study to accomplish its aims while having the most efficient and cost-effective design possible. We typically use true probability sampling procedures for studies. This can involve address-based sampling for mail studies as well as for in-person studies in the New England area, list-assisted random-digit-dialing procedures for state and national telephone studies (including both landline and/or cellular phone numbers), methods for randomly sampling from lists and methods for using web-based surveys by either emailing individual links to sample members or posting a link on websites for recruitment of respondents. CSR also has extensive experience with dual-frame and multi-mode designs. Stratification and clustering are used within sample designs if it is necessary for the aims or for the cost structure of a study. If such complex sampling methods are used, all data files clearly identify the strata and/or clusters so they can be properly accounted for in analyses. CSR also produces estimated design effects and sample weights required for analysis of data from complex sampling. In addition, CSR has experience using Internet panels for data collection using web-based surveys when such a design serves the purposes of the study. CSR can recommend when panels are appropriate and when panel data can or should not be merged with data from other types of samples.
