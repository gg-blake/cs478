Through the Office for Faculty Development, we have been working to build programs, services and above all, relationships, in support of these needs. In their home departments, pre-tenured faculty will find individualized support from the chair and dedicated faculty mentors. Some departments employ group mentoring as well. All departments are required to have written mentoring plans for pre-tenured faculty . While these plans differ, each department should have a plan designed to assist faculty in reaching their potential in the three areas of review: scholarship, teaching and service. Those plans are in the process of being collected and posted. Many are now available: College of Education and Human Development Counseling and School of Psychology Curriculum and Instruction Leadership in Education College of Liberal Arts Africana Studies American Studies Anthropology Applied Linguistics Art Asian Studies Classics Communications Economics English History Latin American and Iberian Studies Performing Arts Philosophy Political Science Psychology Sociology Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies College of Management Accounting and Finance Management Management Science and Information Systems Marketing School for the Environment SFE Mentoring for Pre and Post Tenure Faculty 2024 Manning College of Nursing and Health Sciences Exercise Health Sciences Nursing College of Science and Mathematics Biology Chemistry Computer Science Engineering Mathematics Physics McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies Gerontology Public Policy and Public Affairs UMass 100 Morrissey Blvd. Boston, MA 02125 617.287.5000 Contact UMass Boston Directory Employment Civil Rights & Title IX Map Safety & Security Transportation Document Converter Website Requests Back To Top Instagram Facebook LinkedIn TikTok YouTube Copyright © University of Massachusetts Boston UMass System Accessibility Statement Privacy & Terms
