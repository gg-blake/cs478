Begin the path toward becoming a history educator. UMass Boston's Certificate in History provides hands-on, graduate-level training in the study of history. The Certificate is ideal for those with a passion for history who do not have the time or professional need to pursue a full MA. It provides teachers with the subject matter coursework to progress towards professional licensure and renewal of professional licensure. It also offers students an opportunity to determine whether they want to continue their historical study; at any point in the certificate, students may switch into the History MA program. The certificate balances courses on the professional study of history (Research and Methods and Historiography) with three content electives of the student’s choice. The certificate could be a fit for you if you are: 1) a UMass Boston MEd student looking to fulfill content area requirements or graduate content courses for professional licensure 2) a UMass Boston student already enrolled in an non-History MA program or 3) a teacher with an initial license who needs to complete coursework for professional licensure or for professional development points. Candidates must meet standards similar to those of the MA program. Once students have completed all required and elective courses, they will be awarded the Certificate.
