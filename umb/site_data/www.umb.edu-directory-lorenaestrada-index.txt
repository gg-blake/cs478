DOI:10.1007/s11524-006-9053-6 Additional Information I am interested in understanding and reducing health inequities, particularly those related to mental health outcomes in racial/ethnic minorities and immigrant communities in the U.S. I study these issues through examining neighborhood and family environments as contexts for risk and protection. My most recent interests center on how climate change and natural disasters - such as floods, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes - influence individual and community mental health. I am particularly interested in how impacted communities develop strategies for building mental health resilience.
