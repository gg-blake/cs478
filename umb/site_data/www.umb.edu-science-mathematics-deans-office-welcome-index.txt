In recognition of our excellence, major sponsors of research are investing in UMass Boston at greater levels; sponsors such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and NASA, to name just a few. The College of Science and Mathematics (CSM) is home to many undergraduate and graduate programs. We strive to offer cutting edge curriculum and innovative pedagogies for our students. The skills and practices our students develop in courses and research labs prepare them to become well rounded scientists, dentists, physicians, mathematicians, computer scientists, biomedical workers, school teachers, and technical experts. The majority of our graduates live and work in Massachusetts—making vital contributions to maintaining and strengthening the Commonwealth. I invite you to explore our website and learn more about the many exciting opportunities awaiting you at the CSM, and to learn more about the important research conducted by our faculty and students in Boston-area communities, schools, and health facilities.
