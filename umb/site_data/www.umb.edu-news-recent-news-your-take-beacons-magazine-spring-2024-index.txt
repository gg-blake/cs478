    Beacons Magazine For this issue of Beacons, we asked our alumni: What was your favorite view on campus? 42% Harborwalk 26% Other 16% The Ryan Lounge at McCormack Hall 12% Campus Center 4% Residence Halls Below are quotes from our alumni about the different views: Harborwalk “As an alum and current staff member, I find a brief stop at the Harborwalk a way to ground myself and tackle the day. It’s not just the view, it’s the sounds and smells of the ocean that bring a sense of peace in the middle of the city. It’s also the best spot to watch the sunrise! It’s breathtaking!” —Dianne Kirkpatrick ’18 “Many a walk or bike ride along this peaceful and scenic strip were calming reminders of the happiness found in the simple pleasures of life.” —Arlene Conn ’82 “It seemed like it was another world way back in the early 80s. Small things meant a lot. The Harborwalk was important to me in those days. Every time I felt blue and lonely, I would go to the Harborwalk and gaze at the blue ocean, always remembering that my homeland, Morocco, was straight across, just on the other side of the horizon. That made me feel at peace.” —Mohammed Zefzaf ’85 Ryan Lounge “The view allowed me to relax while studying.  It was almost like a respite for a short time.” —Nancy Doherty ’01 Other “The eighth floor of Healey Library offered the best view of the Harbor, as well as a place to quietly study.” —Jonathan Burak ’11 Q: What is your favorite tourist attraction in Boston?
