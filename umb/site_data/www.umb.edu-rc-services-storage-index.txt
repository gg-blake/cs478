Currently available scratch space resides on the hpcstor6, hpcstor1 and hpcstor4 fileservers. hpcstor6 The hpcstor6 fileserver is accessible to the new chimera cluster. This server is connected via the infiniband network, which has moderately better performance than the home directories.  Any I/O intensive work should utilize this space (known as 'scratch' space) rather than home directories. When you login one of the clusters (chimera), you can access your scratch space at the following path: /hpcstor6/scratch01/[first letter of your username]/username *hpcstor6 is our new fileserver it will replace hpcstor1 in the near future. If you have data on hpcstor1, please move it to hpcstor6. Be aware that scratch space is not backed up and may be subject to purging. Please use the scratch space for I/O intensive jobs. hpcstor1 The hpcstor1 fileserver is accessible to both chimera and gibbs clusters. This server is connected via the infiniband network, which has moderately better performance than the home directories.  Any I/O intensive work should utilize this space (known as 'scratch' space) rather than home directories. When you login one of the clusters (chimera or gibbs), you can access your scratch space at the following path: For the first letter of your username is a-m: /hpcstor1/scratch01/[first letter of your username]/username For the first letter of your username is n-z: /hpcstor1/scratch02/[first letter of your username]/username Be aware that scratch space is not backed up and may be subject to purging. Please use the scratch space for I/O intensive jobs. hpcstor4 The hpcstor4 fileserver is accessible at /hpcstor4/, and is available for our users with data encryption requirements or other specific needs.  Please contact us with access requests.
