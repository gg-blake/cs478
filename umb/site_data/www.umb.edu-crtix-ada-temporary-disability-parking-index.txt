Individuals with a temporary medical condition or disability that limits mobility may obtain a temporary permit that will provide accessible parking privileges for a limited period of time. Individuals with a medical condition or disability that is expected to limit mobility for more than eight (8) weeks should consider obtaining a state-issued disability placard (and/or state-issued disability parking license plate). Accessible parking is available in all UMass Boston parking structures and lots. Accessible parking spaces are marked with an accessible parking sign in front of the parking space and/or indicated by blue stenciling on the ground surface of the parking space. Parking in an accessible parking space without a valid state-issued disability placard, a disability parking license plate, or a Temporary Accessible Parking Permit may result in a parking citation.
