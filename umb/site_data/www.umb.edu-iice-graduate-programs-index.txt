The CIE concentration is designed to develop leaders concerned with global urban education issues and the interrelationships between our local and global educational contexts. The CIE concentration will appeal to leaders seeking to expand their work to address international and transnational problems related to urban education, and will prepare students considering careers in the following areas: academic and research institutions both in the US and internationally; policy-oriented leadership roles in a variety of institutions with educational mandates, including international non-governmental organizations, private foundations and United Nations-affiliated agencies; US K-12 schools working with, for instance, immigrant students, multi-ethnic communities and global citizenship education; and leadership positions in K-12 schools and Ministries of Education outside the US. MEd Program in Educational Administration The MEd Program in Educational Administration – China Cohort is designed for Chinese applicants who are interested in studying educational leadership in schools or related institutions. The program also serves as a foundation for further graduate study. All students in the program enroll in core courses providing a comprehensive view of educational leadership, which includes classes in leadership, organizations and change, as well as courses in curriculum, personnel supervision, school law, budgeting, multicultural perspectives in education, and how to use data for school improvement. The program uses a cohort model and accepts students once a year.
