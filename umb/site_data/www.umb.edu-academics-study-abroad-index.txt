Financing Study Abroad Learn how to make your study abroad program affordable through program choice, financial aid, and scholarships. I cannot recommend enough doing an abroad program. Not only does it bring entire levels of education to be immersed in, but it’s a memory you carry with you for the rest of your life. You’re going to find yourself hungry for more travel, more experiences, and maybe to return to the place at which you do your abroad program. Marie Alessandro, ’22, Communication Diversity & Inclusion While Studying Abroad While all students face challenges living abroad, you may find additional factors that influence your experience. Perhaps you are a non-traditional student who can’t take too much time off work—or you have concerns based on your race, ethnicity, disability, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. At UMass Boston, we believe all students should have the opportunity to study abroad regardless of their background. We’ve compiled resources that can be used to help support your goals. Our Office of Study Abroad staff will do whatever they can to ensure that you have a happy, safe, and rewarding time living abroad.
