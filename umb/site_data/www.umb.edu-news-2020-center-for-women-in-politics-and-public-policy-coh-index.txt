This is of great importance as the needs and voices of women of color have been not been fully considered in the policy process,” said Laurie Nsiah-Jefferson, director of UMass Boston’s Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy. MAWOCC President Celia J. Blue said, “Civic engagement and getting out the vote have always been major areas of concern for women of color. This year, while we recognize the 100th anniversary of the women’s suffrage movement, we must acknowledge that the voices of women of color were not always heard and valued and that only means the work continues with a sense of urgency like never before. While we have come far, we still have much further to go.” The two-day virtual conference will feature a morning town hall session on voting, voter suppression, and civic engagement. An interactive “She the People” panel featuring women of color leaders past and present who have and are currently blazing trails in political and civic arenas. The event is free and open to the public, but registration is required. To register for the virtual seminar, please visit: cutt.ly/our-power .
