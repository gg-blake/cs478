His research utilizes geochemical measurements of marine fossils to decipher how, why, and how quickly Earth’s carbon cycle changed during intervals of climate instability in Earth’s history. With this knowledge, he seeks to better understand how human carbon emissions will affect our future climate. Jesse comes to SFE from a postdoctoral fellowship jointly between the Sigman laboratory at Princeton University and the Climate Geochemistry group of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.
