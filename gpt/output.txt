In a severance agreement, signed and dated by then Marlboro Mayer Nancy Stevens and Plummer on the same day Plummer handed in his resignation papers, Plummer received $17,500 at the time of his departure.

Stevens declined to comment at the time on how the parties came to agree on the severance package, but said it was "not unusual" for municipal employees to be given a payment when they leave.

She also said that she and Plummer , who was the city’s top pick out of 42 applicants, had conversations in the time leading up to his resignation, but declined to say what they spoke about. Stevens said it's her policy not to discuss personnel matters.

Shortly after Plummer’s resignation in Marlboro, Bill Taylor, president of the firefighters union, had said he believed Stevens fired Plummer, and questioned why someone who left his job voluntarily would be eligible for severance.

City officials maintained that Plummer's decision to leave was his own. Plummer agreed, in the severance document, that he was resigning on his own accord.
